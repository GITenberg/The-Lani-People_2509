    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The boxed ad in the opportunities section of the Kardon Journal of Allied
      Medical Sciences stood out like a cut diamond in a handful of gravel.
      "Wanted," it read, "Veterinarian&mdash;for residency in active livestock
      operation. Single recent graduate preferred. Quarters and service
      furnished. Well-equipped hospital. Five-year contract, renewal option,
      starting salary 15,000 cr./annum with periodic increases. State age,
      school, marital status, and enclose recent tri-di with application.
      Address Box V-9, this journal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jac Kennon read the box a second time. There must be a catch to it.
      Nothing that paid a salary that large could possibly be on the level.
      Fifteen thousand a year was top pay even on Beta, and an offer like this
      for a new graduate was unheard of&mdash;unless Kardon was in the middle of
      an inflation. But Kardon wasn't. The planet's financial status was A-1. He
      knew. He'd checked that immediately after landing. Whatever might be wrong
      with Kardon, it wasn't her currency. The rate of exchange was 1.2-1 Betan.
    </p>
    <p>
      A five-year contract&mdash;hmm&mdash;that would be seventy-five thousand.
      Figure three thousand a year for living expenses, that would leave
      sixty-plenty of capital to start a clinic. The banks couldn't turn him
      down if he had that much cash collateral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled wryly. He'd better get the job before he started spending
      the money he didn't have. He had 231 credits plus a few halves, tenths,
      and hundredths, a diploma in veterinary medicine, some textbooks, a few
      instruments, and a first-class spaceman's ticket. By watching his expenses
      he had enough money to live here for a month and if nothing came of his
      efforts to find a job on this planet, there was always his spaceman's
      ticket and another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another world! There were over six thousand planets in the Brotherhood of
      Man. At two months per planet, not figuring transit time, it would take
      more than a thousand Galactic Standard years to visit them all, and a man
      could look forward to scarcely more than five hundred at best. The habitat
      of Man had become too large. There wasn't time to explore every
      possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a man could have certain standards, and look until he found a position
      that fitted. The trouble was&mdash;if the standards were too high the jobs
      were too scarce. Despite the chronic shortage of veterinarians throughout
      the Brotherhood, there was a peculiar reluctance on the part of
      established practitioners to welcome recent graduates. Most of the ads in
      the professional journals read "State salary desired," which was nothing
      more than economic blackmail&mdash;a bald-faced attempt to get as much for
      as little as possible. Kennon grimaced wryly. He'd be damned if he'd sell
      his training for six thousand a year. Slave labor, that's what it was.
      There were a dozen ads like that in the Journal. Well, he'd give them a
      trial, but he'd ask eight thousand and full GEA benefits. Eight years of
      school and two more as an intern were worth at least that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the portable voicewrite to a comfortable position in front of
      the view wall and began composing another of the series of letters that
      had begun months ago in time and parsecs away in space. His voice was a
      fluid counterpoint to the soft hum of the machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he dictated, his eyes took in the vista through the view wall.
      Albertsville was a nice town, too young for slums, too new for
      overpopulation. The white buildings were the color of winter butter in the
      warm yellow sunlight as the city drowsed in the noonday heat. It nestled
      snugly in the center of a bowl-shaped valley whose surrounding forest clad
      hills gave mute confirmation to the fact that Kardon was still primitive,
      an unsettled world that had not yet reached the explosive stage of
      population growth that presaged maturity. But that was no disadvantage. In
      fact, Kennon liked it. Living could be fun on a planet like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was abysmally crude compared to Beta, but the Brotherhood had opened
      Kardon less than five hundred years ago, and in such a short time one
      couldn't expect all the comforts of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required a high population density to supply them, and while Kardon was
      integrated its population was scarcely more than two hundred million. It
      would be some time yet before this world would achieve a Class I status.
      However, a Class II planet had some advantages. What it lacked in
      conveniences it made up in opportunities and elbow room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A normal Betan would have despised this world, but Kennon wasn't normal,
      although to the casual eye he was a typical representative of the
      Medico-Technological Civilization, long legged, fair haired, and short
      bodied with the typical Betan squint that left his eyes mere slits behind
      thick lashes and heavy brows. The difference was internal rather than
      external.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly it was due to the fact that his father was the commander of a
      Shortliner and most of his formative years had been spent in space. To
      Kennon, accustomed to the timeless horror of hyper space, all planets were
      good, broad open places where a man could breathe unfiltered air and look
      for miles across distances unbroken by dually bulk heads and safety
      shields. On a planet there were spaciousness and freedom and after the
      claustrophobic confinement of a hyper ship any world was paradise. Kennon
      sighed, finished his letters, and placed them in the mail chute. Perhaps,
      this time, there would be a favorable reply.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kennon was startled by the speed with which his letters were answered.
      Accustomed to the slower pace of Beta he had expected a week would elapse
      before the first reply, but within twenty-four hours nine of his twelve
      inquiries were returned. Five expressed the expected "Thank you but I feel
      that your asking salary is a bit high in view of your lack of experience."
      Three were frankly interested and requested a personal interview. And the
      last was the letter, outstanding in its quietly ostentatious folder-the
      reply from Box V-9.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would Dr. Kennon call at 10 A.M. tomorrow at the offices of Outworld
      Enterprises Incorporated and bring this letter and suitable
      identifications?" Kennon chuckled. Would he? There was no question about
      it. The address, 200 Central Avenue, was only a few blocks away. In fact,
      he could see the building from his window, a tall functional block of
      durilium and plastic, soaring above the others on the street, the sunlight
      gleaming off its clean square lines. He eyed it curiously, wondering what
      he would find inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      The receptionist took his I.D. and the letter, scanned them briefly, and
      slipped them into one of the message tubes beside her desk. "It will only
      be a moment, Doctor," she said impersonally. "Would you care to sit down?
      '"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said. The minute, reflected, could easily be an hour. But
      she was right. It was only a minute until the message tube clicked and
      popped a capsule onto the girl's desk. She opened it, and removed Kennon's
      I.D. and a small yellow plastic rectangle. Her eyes widened at the sight
      of the plastic card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here you are, Doctor. Take shaft number one. Slip the card into the
      scanner slot and you'll be taken to the correct floor. The offices you
      want will be at the end of the corridor to the left. You'll find any other
      data you may need on the card in case you get lost." She looked at him
      with a curious mixture of surprise and respect as she handed him the
      contents of the message tube.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon murmured an acknowledgment, took the card and his I.D., and entered
      the grav-shaft. There was the usual moment of heaviness as the shaft
      whisked him upward and deposited him in front of a thickly carpeted
      corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Executive level, Kennon thought as he followed the receptionist's
      directions. No wonder she had looked respectful. But what was he doing
      here? The employment of a veterinarian wasn't important enough to demand
      the attention of a senior executive. The personnel section could handle
      the details of his application as well as not. He shrugged. Perhaps
      veterinarians were more important on Kardon. He didn't know a thing about
      this world's customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the unmarked door at the end of the corridor, entered a small
      reception room, smiled uncertainly at the woman behind the desk, and
      received an answering smile in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come right in, Dr. Kennon. Mr. Alexander is waiting for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander! The entrepreneur himself! Why? Numb with surprise Kennon
      watched the woman open the intercom on her desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, Dr. Kennon is here," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring him in," a smooth voice replied from the speaker. Alexander X. M.
      Alexander, President of Outworld Enterprises&mdash;a lean, dark, wolfish
      man in his early sixties&mdash;eyed Kennon with a flat predatory
      intentness that was oddly disquieting. His stare combined the analytical
      inspection of the pathologist, the probing curiosity of the psychiatrist,
      and the weighing appraisal of the butcher. Kennon's thoughts about
      Alexander's youth vanished that instant. Those eyes belonged to a leader
      on the battlefield of galactic business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon felt the conditioned respect for authority surge through him in a
      smothering wave. Grimly he fought it down, knowing it was a sign of
      weakness that would do him no good in the interview which lay ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're Kennon," Alexander said. His lingua franca was clean and
      accentless. "I expected someone older."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frankly, sir, so did I," Kennon replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander smiled, an oddly pleasant smile that transformed the hard
      straight lines in his face into friendly curves. "Business, Dr. Kennon, is
      not the sole property of age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor is a veterinary degree," Kennon replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. But one thinks of a Betan as someone ancient and sedate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ours is an old planet&mdash;but we still have new generations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fact most of us outsiders find hard to believe," Alexander said. "I
      picture your world as an ironclad society crystallized by age and custom
      into something rigid and in flexible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would be wrong to do so," Kennon said. "Even though we are cultural
      introverts there is plenty of dynamism within our society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it that you happen to be out here on the edge of civilization?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said I was like my society," Kennon grinned. "Actually I suppose
      I'm one of the proverbial bad apples."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more to it than that," Alexander said. "Your early years probably
      influenced you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked sharply at the entrepreneur. How much did the man really
      know about him? "I suppose so," he said indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander looked pleased. "But even with your childhood experiences there
      must be an atavistic streak in you&mdash;a throwback to your adventurous
      Earth forebears who settled your world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. "Perhaps you're right. I really don't know. Actually,
      I've never thought about it. It merely seemed to me that an undeveloped
      world offered more opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does," Alexander said. "But it also offers more work. If you're
      figuring that you can get along on the minimum physical effort required on
      the Central Worlds, you have a shock coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not that innocent," Kennon said. "But I am not so stupid that I can't
      apply modifications of Betan techniques to worlds as new as this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander chuckled. "I like you," he said suddenly. "Here read this and
      see if you'd care to work for me." He picked a contract form from one of
      the piles of paper on his desk and handed it to Kennon. "This is one of
      our standard work contracts. Take it back to your hotel and check it over.
      I'll expect to see you at this time tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why waste time?" Kennon said. "The rapid-reading technique originated on
      Beta. I can tell you in fifteen minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hmm. Certainly. Read it here if you wish. I like to get things settled&mdash;the
      sooner the better. Sit down, young man and read. You can rouse me when
      you're finished." He turned his attention to the papers on his desk and
      within seconds was completely oblivious of Kennon, his face set in the
      rapt trancelike expression of a trained rapid reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon watched for a moment as sheets of paper passed through Alexander's
      hands to be added to the pile at the opposite end of the desk. The man
      would do better, he thought, if he would have his staff transcribe the
      papers to microfilm that could be read through an interval-timed scanner.
      He might suggest that later. As for now, he shrugged and seated himself in
      the chair beside the desk. The quiet was broken only by the rustle of
      paper as the two rapt-faced men turned page after page with mechanical
      regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Kennon turned the last page, paused, blinked, and performed the
      necessary mental gymnastics to orient his time sense. Alexander, he
      noticed, was still engrossed, sunk in his autohypnotic trance. Kennon
      waited until he had finished the legal folder which he was reading and
      then gently intruded upon Alexander's concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander looked up blankly and then went through the same mental
      gyrations Kennon had performed a few minutes before. His eyes focused and
      became hard and alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he asked. "What do you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's the damnedest, trickiest, most unilateral piece of
      legalistics I've ever seen," Kennon said bluntly. "If that's the best you
      can offer, I wouldn't touch the job with a pair of forceps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander smiled. "I see you read the fine print," he said. There was
      quiet amusement in his voice. "So you don't like the contract?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sensible man would. I'm damned if I'll sign commitment papers just to
      get a job. No wonder you're having trouble getting professional help. If
      your contracts are all like that it's' a wonder anyone works for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have no complaints from our employees," Alexander said stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could you? If they signed that contract you'd have a perfect right to
      muzzle them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are other applicants for this post," Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then get one of them. I wouldn't be interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A spaceman's ticket is a good thing to have," Alexander said idly. "It's
      a useful ace in the hole. Besides, you have had three other job offers&mdash;all
      of which are good even though they don't pay fifteen Ems a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon did a quick double take. Alexander's investigative staff was better
      than good. It was uncanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But seriously, Dr. Kennon, I am pleased that you do not like that
      contract. Frankly, I wouldn't consider employing you if you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That contract is a screen. It weeds out the careless, the fools, and the
      unfit in one operation. A man who would sign a thing like that has no
      place in my organization." Alexander chuckled at Kennon's blank
      expression. "I see you have had no experience with screening contracts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't," Kennon admitted. "On Beta the tests are formal. The
      Medico-Psych Division supervises them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Different worlds, different methods," Alexander observed. "But they're
      all directed toward the same goal. Here we aren't so civilized. We depend
      more on personal judgment." He took another contract from one of the
      drawers of his desk. "Take a look at this. I think you'll be more
      satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you don't mind, I'll read it now," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's fair enough," Kennon said, "except for Article Twelve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The personal privilege section?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's the contract. You can take it or leave it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll leave it," Kennon said. "Thank you for your time." He rose to his
      feet, smiled at Alexander, and turned to the door. "Don't bother to call
      your receptionist," he said. "I can find my way out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a minute, Doctor," Alexander said. He was standing behind the desk,
      holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another test?" Kennon inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander nodded. "The critical one," he said. "Do you want the job?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without knowing more about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The contract is adequate. It defines my duties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think you can handle them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I notice," Alexander observed, "that you didn't object to other
      provisions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir. They're pretty rigid, but for the salary you are paying I figure
      you should have some rights. Certainly you have the right to protect your
      interests. But that Article Twelve is a direct violation of everything a
      human being should hold sacred besides being a violation of the Peeper
      Laws. I'd never sign a contract that didn't carry a full Peeper rider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's quite a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the minimum," Kennon corrected. "Naturally, I won't object to
      mnemonic erasure of matters pertaining to your business once my contract's
      completed and I leave your employment. But until then there will be no
      conditioning, no erasures, no taps, no snoopers, and no checkups other
      than the regular periodic psychans. I'll consult with you on vacation time
      and will arrange it to suit your convenience. I'll even agree to emergency
      recall, but that's the limit." Kennon's voice was flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You realize I'm agreeing to give you a great deal of personal liberty,"
      Alexander said. "How can I protect myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll sign a contingency rider," Kennon said, "if you will specify
      precisely what security matters I am not to reveal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept," Alexander said. "Consider yourself hired." He touched a button
      on his desk. "Prepare a standard 2-A contract for Dr. Jac Kennon's
      signature. And attach two riders, a full P-P-yes, no exceptions&mdash;and
      a security-leak contingency, Form 287-C. Yes&mdash;that's right&mdash;that
      one. And strike out all provisions of Article Twelve which conflict with
      the Peeper Laws. Yes. Now&mdash;and finish it as soon as you can." He
      touched another button. "Well, that's that," he said. "I hope you'll enjoy
      being a member of our group."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I shall," Kennon said. "You know, sir, I would have waived part
      of that last demand if you had cared to argue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," Alexander said. "But what concessions I could have wrung from
      you would be relatively unimportant beside the fact that you would be
      unhappy about them later. What little I could have won here, I'd lose
      elsewhere. And since I want you, I'd prefer to have you satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," Kennon said. Actually he didn't see at all. He looked curiously
      at the entrepreneur. Alexander couldn't be as easy as he seemed.
      Objectivity and dispassionate weighing and balancing were nice traits and
      very helpful ones, but in the bear pit of galactic business they wouldn't
      keep their owner alive for five minutes. The interworld trade sharks would
      have skinned him long ago and divided the stripped carcass of his company
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Outworld was a "respected" company. The exchange reports said so&mdash;which
      made Alexander a different breed of cat entirely. Still, his surface was
      perfect&mdash;polished and impenetrable as a duralloy turret on one of the
      latest Brotherhood battleships. Kennon regretted he wasn't a sensitive. It
      would be nice to know what Alexander really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, sir," Kennon asked. "What are the real reasons that make you
      think I'm the man you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you're the young man who's so insistent on a personal privacy rider,"
      Alexander chuckled. "However, there's no harm telling you. There are
      several reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're from a culture whose name is a byword for moral integrity. That
      makes you a good risk so far as your ethics are concerned. In addition
      you're the product of one of the finest educational systems in the
      galaxy-and you have proven your intelligence to my satisfaction. You also
      showed me that you weren't a spineless 'yes man.' And finally, you have a
      spirit of adventure. Not one in a million of your people would do what you
      have done. What more could an entrepreneur ask of a prospective employee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sighed and gave up. Alexander wasn't going to reveal a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I hope," Alexander continued affably, "is that you'll find Outworld
      Enterprises as attractive as did your predecessor Dr. Williamson. He was
      with us until he died last month&mdash;better than a hundred years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Died rather young, didn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not exactly, he was nearly four hundred when he joined us. My grandfather
      was essentially conservative. He liked older men, and Old Doc was one of
      his choices&mdash;a good one, too. He was worth every credit we paid him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try to do as well," Kennon said, "but I'd like to warn you that I
      have no intention of staying as long as he did. I want to build a clinic
      and I figure sixty thousand is about enough to get started."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will you veterinarians ever learn to be organization men?" Alexander
      asked. "You're as independent as tomcats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon grinned. "It's a breed characteristic, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander shrugged. "Perhaps you'll change your mind after you've worked
      for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly, but I doubt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me that five years from now," Alexander said&mdash;"Ah&mdash;here
      are the contracts." He smiled at the trim secretary who entered the room
      carrying a stack of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The riders are as you asked, sir," the girl said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Now, Doctor, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't mind if I check them?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. And when you're through, just leave them on the desk&mdash;except
      for your copy, of course." Alexander scrawled his signature on the bottom
      of each contract. "Don't disturb me. I'll be in contact with you. Leave
      your whereabouts with your hotel." He turned to the papers in front of
      him, and then looked up for the last time. "Just one more thing," he said.
      "You impress me as a cautious man. It would be just as well if you carried
      your caution with you when you leave this room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded, and Alexander turned back to his work.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I'd never have guessed yesterday that I'd be here today," Kennon said as
      he looked down at the yellow waters of the Xantline Sea flashing to the
      rear of the airboat at a steady thousand kilometers per hour as they sped
      westward in the middle traffic level. The water, some ten thousand meters
      below, had been completely empty for hours as the craft hurtled through
      the equatorial air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to move fast to stay ahead of our ulcers," Alexander said with a
      wry smile. "Besides, I wanted to get away from the Albertsville offices
      for awhile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three hours' notice," Kennon said. "That's almost too fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had nothing to keep you in the city, and neither did I&mdash;at least
      nothing important. There are plenty of females where we are going and I
      need you on Flora&mdash;not in Albertsville. Besides I can get you there
      faster than if you waited for a company transport."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judging from those empty sea lanes below, Flora must be an out-of-the-way
      place," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. It's out of the trade lanes. Most of the commercial traffic is in
      the southern hemisphere. The northern hemisphere is practically all water.
      Except for Flora and the Otpens there isn't a land area for nearly three
      thousand kilometers in any direction, and since the company owns Flora and
      the surrounding island groups there's no reason for shipping to come
      there. We have our own supply vessels, a Discovery Charter, and a desire
      for privacy.&mdash;Ah! It won't be long now. There's the Otpens!"
      Alexander pointed at a smudge on the horizon that quickly resolved into an
      irregular chain of tiny islets that slipped below them. Kennon got a
      glimpse of gray concrete on one of the larger islands, a smudge of green
      trees, and white beaches against which the yellow waters dashed in
      smothers of foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rugged-looking place," he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of them are deserted. Two support search and warning stations and
      automatic interceptors to protect our property. Look!&mdash;there's
      Flora." Alexander gestured at the land mass that appeared below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was a great green oval two hundred kilometers long and about a
      hundred wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty, isn't it?" Alexander said as they sped over the low range of
      hills and the single gaunt volcano filling the eastward end of the island
      and swept over a broad green valley dotted with fields and orchards
      interspersed at intervals by red-roofed structures whose purpose was
      obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our farms," Alexander said redundantly. The airboat crossed a fair-sized
      river. "That's the Styx," Alexander said. "Grandfather named it. He was a
      classicist in his way&mdash;spent a lot of his time reading books most
      people never heard of. Things like the Iliad and Gone with the Wind. The
      mountains he called the Apennines, and that volcano's Mount Olympus. The
      marshland to the north is called the Pontine Marshes&mdash;our main road
      is the Camino Real." Alexander grinned. "There's a lot of Earth on Flora.
      You'll find it in every name. Grandfather was an Earthman and he used to
      get nostalgic for the homeworld. Well&mdash;there's Alexandria coming up.
      We've just about reached the end of the line."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon stared down at the huge gray-green citadel resting on a small hill
      in the center of an open plain. It was a Class II Fortalice built on the
      efficient star-shaped plan of half a millennium ago&mdash;an ugly spiky
      pile of durilium, squat and massive with defensive shields and weapons
      which could still withstand hours of assault by the most modern forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he build a thing like that?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alexandria?&mdash;well, we had trouble with the natives when we first
      came, and Grandfather had a synthesizer and tapes for a Fortalice in his
      ship. So he built it. It serves the dual purpose of base and house. It's
      mostly house now, but it's still capable of being defended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And those outbuildings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're part of your job."
    </p>
    <p>
      The airboat braked sharply and settled with a smooth, sickeningly swift
      rush that left Kennon gasping&mdash;feeling that his stomach was still
      floating above him in the middle level. He never had become accustomed to
      an arbutus landing characteristics. Spacers were slower and steadier. The
      ship landed gently on a pitted concrete slab near the massive radiation
      shields of the barricaded entranceway to the fortress. Projectors in
      polished dually turrets swivelled to point their ugly noses at them. It
      gave Kennon a queasy feeling. He never liked to trust his future to
      automatic machinery. If the analyzers failed to decode the ship's I.D.
      properly, Kennon, Alexander, the ship, and a fair slice of surrounding
      territory would become an incandescent mass of dissociated atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grandfather was a good builder," Alexander, said proudly. "Those
      projectors have been mounted nearly four hundred years and they're still
      as good as the day they were installed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see that," Kennon said uncomfortably. "You ought to dismantle them.
      They're enough to give a man the weebies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander chuckled. "Oh&mdash;they're safe. The firing mechanism's
      safetied. But we keep them in operating condition. You never can tell when
      they'll come in handy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew Kardon was primitive, but I didn't think it was that bad. What's
      the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None&mdash;right now," Alexander said obliquely, "and since we've shown
      we can handle ourselves there probably won't be any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must raise some pretty valuable stock if the competition tried to
      rustle them in the face of that armament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do." Alexander said. "Now if you'll follow me"&mdash;the entrepreneur
      opened the cabin door letting in a blast of heat and a flood of yellow
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Arthur Fleming!" Kennon exploded. "This place is a furnace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's hot out here on the strip," Alexander admitted, "but its cool enough
      inside. Besides, you'll get used to this quickly enough&mdash;and the
      nights are wonderful. The evening rains cool things off. Well&mdash;come
      along." He began walking toward the arched entrance to the great building
      some hundred meters away. Kennon followed looking around curiously. So
      this was to be his home for the next five years? It didn't look
      particularly inviting. There was a forbidding air about the place that was
      in stark contrast to its pleasant surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were only a few meters from the archway when a stir of movement came
      from its shadow&mdash;the first life Kennon had seen since they descended
      from the ship. In this furnace heat even the air was quiet. Two women came
      out of the darkness, moving with quiet graceful steps across the
      blistering hot concrete. They were naked except for a loincloth, halter,
      and sandals and so nearly identical in form and feature that Kennon took
      them to be twins. Their skins were burned a deep brown that glistened in
      the yellow sun light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. It was none of his business how his employer ran his
      household or what his servants wore or didn't wear. Santos was a planet of
      nudists, and certainly this hot sun was fully as brilliant as the one
      which warmed that tropical planet In fact, he could see some virtue in
      wearing as little as possible. Already he was perspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women walked past them toward the airboat. Kennon turned to look
      at them and noticed with surprise that they weren't human. The long tails
      curled below their spinal bases were adequate denials of human ancestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humanoids!" he gasped. "For a moment I thought-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gave you a start-eh?" Alexander chuckled. "It always does when a stranger
      sees a Lani for the first time. Well&mdash;now you've seen some of the
      livestock what do you think of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you should have hired a medic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander shook his head. "No&mdash;it wouldn't be reason able or legal.
      You're the man for the job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I've no experience with humanoid types. We didn't cover that phase in
      our studies&mdash;and from their appearance they'd qualify as humans
      anywhere if it weren't for those tails!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're far more similar than you think," Alexander said. "It just goes
      to show what parallel evolution can do. But there are differences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew that there was indigenous humanoid life on Kardon," Kennon
      continued. "The manual says nothing about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally. They're indigenous only to this area."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's impossible. Species as highly organized as that simply don't
      originate on isolated islands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was a subcontinent once," Alexander said. "Most of it has been
      inundated. Less than a quarter of a million years ago there was over a
      hundred times the land area in this region than exists today. Then the
      ocean rose. Now all that's left is the mid continent plateau and a few
      mountain tops. You noted, I suppose, that this is mature topography except
      for that range of hills to the east. The whole land area at the time of
      flooding was virtually a peneplain. A rise of a few hundred feet in the
      ocean level was all that was needed to drown most of the land."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Yes, it's possible that life could have developed here under those
      conditions. A peneplain topography argues permanence for hundreds of
      millions of years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have studied geology?" Alexander asked curiously. "Only as part of my
      cultural base," Kennon said. "Merely a casual acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We think the Lani were survivors of that catastrophe&mdash;and with their
      primitive culture they were unable to reach the other land masses,"
      Alexander shrugged. "At any rate they never established themselves
      anywhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you happen to come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was born here," Alexander said. "My grandfather discovered this world
      better than four hundred years ago. He picked this area because it all
      could be comfortably included in Discovery Rights. It wasn't until years
      afterward that he realized the ecological peculiarities of this region."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly capitalized on them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was plenty of opportunity. The plants and animals here are
      different from others in this world. Like Australia in reverse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked blank, and Alexander chuckled. "Australia was a subcontinent
      on Earth," he explained. "Its ecology, however, was exceedingly primitive
      when compared with the rest of the planet. Flora's on the contrary, was&mdash;and
      is&mdash;exceedingly advanced when compared with other native life forms
      on Kardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grandfather stumbled on a real bonanza," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For which I'm grateful," Alexander grinned. "It's made me the biggest
      operator in this sector of the galaxy. For practical purposes I own an
      independent nation. There's about a thousand humans here, and nearly six
      thousand Lani. We're increasing the Lani now, since we found they have
      commercial possibilities. Up to thirty years ago we merely used them for
      labor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon didn't speculate on what Alexander meant. He knew. For practical
      purposes, his employer was a slave trader&mdash;or would have been if the
      natives were human. As it was, the analogy was so close that it wasn't
      funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the fortress, passed through a decontamination chamber that
      would have done credit to an exploration ship, and emerged dressed in
      tunics and sandals that were far more appropriate and comfortable in this
      tropical climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's one of Old Doc's ideas," Alexander said, gesturing at the door
      from which they had emerged. "He was a hound for sanitation and he
      infected us with the habit." He turned and led the way down an arched
      corridor that opened into a huge circular room studded with iris doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sucked his breath in with a low gasp of amazement. The room was a
      gem of exquisite beauty. The parquet floor was inlaid with rare hardwoods
      from a hundred different worlds. Parthian marble veneer covered with lacy
      Van tapestries from Santos formed the walls. Delicate ceramics, sculpture,
      and bronzes reflected the art of a score of different civilizations. A
      circular pool, festooned with lacelike Halsite ferns, stood in the center
      of the room, surrounding a polished black granite pedestal on which stood
      an exquisite bronze of four Lani females industriously and eternally
      pouring golden water from vases held in their shapely hands. "Beautiful,"
      Kennon said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We like it," Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes&mdash;I forgot to tell you about the Family," Alexander said
      grimly. "I run Outworld, and own fifty per cent of it. The Family owns the
      other fifty. There are eight of them&mdash;the finest collection of
      parasites in the entire galaxy. At the moment they can't block me since I
      also control my cousin Douglas's shares. But when Douglas comes of age
      they will be troublesome. Therefore I defer to them. I don't want to build
      a united opposition. Usually I can get one or more of them to vote with me
      on critical deals, but I always have to pay for their support."
      Alexander's voice was bitter as he touched the dilate button on the iris
      door beside him. "You'll have to meet them tonight. There's five of them
      here now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't in the contract," Kennon said. He was appalled at Alexander.
      Civilized people didn't speak of others that way, even to intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be helped. You must meet them. It's part of the job."
      Alexander's voice was grim. "Mother, Cousin Anne, Douglas, and Eloise like
      to play lord of the manor. Cousin Harold doesn't care&mdash;for which you
      should be grateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door dilated, and Alexander ushered Kennon into the room. The Lani
      sitting on the couch opposite the door leaped to her feet, her mouth
      opening in an O of surprise. Her soft snow-white hair, creamy skin, and
      bright china blue eyes were a startling contrast to her black loincloth
      and halter. Kennon stared appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her effect on Alexander, however, was entirely different. His face
      darkened. "You!" he snapped. "What are you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serving, sir," the Lani said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On whose authority?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man Douglas, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander groaned. "You see," he said, turning to Kennon. "We need someone
      here with a little sense. Like I was telling you, the Family'd"&mdash;he
      stopped abruptly and turned back to the Lani. "Your name and pedigree," he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silver Dawn, sir&mdash;out of White Magic&mdash;platinum experimental
      type&mdash;strain four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so. How long have you been inhouse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost a month, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're terminated. Report to Goldie and tell her that Man Alexander wants
      you sent back to your group."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lani's eyes widened. "Man Alexander!&mdash;You?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh!" she breathed. "The big boss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get moving," Alexander snapped, "and tell Goldie to report to me in my
      quarters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, right away, sir!" The Lath ran, disappearing through the door
      they had entered with a flash of shapely white limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Douglas!" Alexander growled. "Leave that young fool alone here for
      six months and he'd disrupt the entire operation. The nerve of that young
      pup&mdash;requisitioning an experimental type for household labor. Just
      what does he think he's doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question obviously didn't demand a reply, so Kennon kept discreetly
      silent as Alexander crossed the room to the two doors flanking the couch
      on which the Lani had sat. He opened the left-hand one revealing a modern
      grav-shaft that carried them swiftly to the uppermost level. They walked
      down a short corridor and stopped before another door. It opened into a
      suite furnished with stark functional simplicity. It fitted the
      entrepreneur's outward personality so exactly that Kennon had no doubt
      that this was Alexander's quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, Kennon. Relax while you can," Alexander said as he dropped into
      a chair and crossed his sandaled feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure you have many questions, but they can wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might as well get some rest. You'll have little enough later. The
      Family will probably put you through the meat grinder, but remember that
      they don't control this business. You're my man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon had hardly seated himself in another chair when the door opened and
      a plump pink-skinned Lani entered. She was considerably older than the
      silver-haired one he had seen earlier, and her round face was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Goldie," Alexander said. "I understand Man Douglas has been giving
      you quite a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's high time you came back, sir," she said. "Since Old Doc died, Man
      Douglas has been impossible. He's been culling the staff and replacing
      them with empty-headed fillies whose only claim to usefulness is that they
      can fill out a halter. Pretty soon this place will be a pigsty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take care of that," Alexander promised. "Now I'd like you to meet
      Old Doc's replacement. This is Dr. Kennon, our new veterinarian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleased, I'm sure," Goldie said. "You look like a nice man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," Alexander said, "but he's just as hard as Old Doc&mdash;and he'll
      have the same powers. Goldie's the head housekeeper," Alexander added.
      "She's an expert, and you'd do well to take her advice on assignments."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a maid bring us a light meal and something to drink," Alexander
      said. "Have a couple of porters take Dr. Kennon's things to Old Doc's
      house. Find Man Douglas and tell him I want to see him at once. Tell the
      Family that I've arrived and will see them in the Main Lounge at eight
      tonight. Tell Blalok I'll be seeing him at nine. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," Goldie said and left the room, her tail curling buoyantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good Lani," Alexander commented. "One of the best. Loyal, trustworthy,
      intelligent. She's been running Alexandria for the past ten years, and
      should be good for at least ten more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten?&mdash;how old is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty&mdash;years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord Lister! I'd have guessed her at least three hundred!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong life scale. Lani only live about one tenth as long as we do.
      They're mature at twelve and dead at fifty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander sighed. "That's another difference. Even without agerone we'd
      live to be a hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you tried gerontological injections?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once. They produced death in about two days. Killed five Lani with them."
      Alexander's face darkened at an unpleasant memory. "So we don't try any
      more," he said. "There are too many differences." He stretched. "I'd tell
      you more about them but it'll be better to hear it from Evald Blalok. He's
      our superintendent. Steve Jordan can tell you a lot, too. He runs the Lani
      Division. But right now let's wait for Cousin Douglas. The pup will take
      his time about coming&mdash;but he'll do it in the end. He's afraid not
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather not," Kennon said. "It's poor manners to be injected into a
      family affair&mdash;especially when I'm just one of the employees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not just one of the employees. You are the Station Veterinarian,
      and as such you hold an authority second only to Blalok and myself. You
      and Blalok are my hands, ears, and eyes on Flora. You are responsible to
      me&mdash;and to me alone. While I defer at times to the desires of the
      Family, I do not have to. I run Outworld Enterprises and all the
      extensions of that organization. I possess control&mdash;and the Family
      knows it. My men are respected and furthermore they know everything that
      goes on." He smiled icily. "In a way it's quite a healthy situation. It
      keeps my relatives under control. Somehow they dislike being disciplined
      before outsiders. Now think no more about it." Alexander stood up and
      walked over to one of the windows opening onto the broad roof gardens, and
      stood looking at the sun-drenched greenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Odd, isn't it," Alexander said, "how beautiful nature is and how simple
      things are in a state of nature. It's only when man interjects himself
      onto a scene that things get complicated. Take Flora for instance. Before
      Grandfather came here, it must have been a pleasant place with the simple
      natives happy in their paradise. But that's all changed now. We have taken
      over&mdash;and they, like other lesser creatures on other worlds, have
      been bent to our will and uses. I could pity them, but being human I
      cannot afford that luxury."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon understood. He, too, had felt that sensation, that odd tightening
      of the throat when he first saw a Varl on Santos. The Varl had been the
      dominant life form there until men had come. Now they were just another
      animal added to humanity's growing list of pets and livestock. The little
      Varl with their soft-furred bodies and clever six-fingered hands made
      excellent pets and precision workmen. The products of those clever hands,
      the tiny instruments, the delicate microminiaturized control circuits, the
      incredibly fine lacework and tapestries, formed the bulk of Santos'
      interstellar trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had owned a Varl once and had delighted in its almost human
      intelligence. But the Varl weren't human and there lay their tragedy. Two
      thousand years of human domination had left them completely dependent on
      their conquerors. They were merely intelligent animals&mdash;and that was
      all they would ever be until the human race changed its cultural pattern
      or was overthrown. The one alternative was as unlikely as the other.
      Humanity had met some fierce competitors, but none with its explosive
      acquisitive nature, and none with its drive to conquer, colonize, and
      rule. And probably it never would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Varl were one race among hundreds that had fallen before the
      fierceness and the greed of men. But unlike most others, the Varl were not
      combative. Therefore they had survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet had it been necessary to reduce them to slavery? They would never be a
      threat. Not only were they essentially gentle and noncombative, but their
      delicate bodies could not stand the strains of spaceflight. They were
      trapped on their world. Why should they be forced into so subordinate a
      role?&mdash;Why was humanity so jealous of its dominance that no other
      species could exist except by sufferance? Why after five thousand years of
      exploration, invasion, and colonization did the human race still consider
      the galaxy as its oyster, and themselves uniquely qualified to hold the
      knife? He hadn't thought this way since he had given the Varl to his girl
      friend of the moment, and had blasted off for Beta. Now the questions
      returned to haunt him. As a Betan, the haunting was even more acute, since
      Beta had a related problem that was already troublesome and would become
      more acute as the years passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged and laid the thought aside as a slim, dark-haired Lani entered
      pushing a service cart ahead of her. The two men ate silently, each busy
      with his own thoughts. And behind the view wall of Alexander's apartment
      Kardon's brilliant yellow sun sank slowly toward the horizon, filling the
      sky with flaming colors of red and gold, rimmed by the blues and purples
      of approaching night. The sunset was gaudy and blatant, Kennon thought
      with mild distaste, unlike the restful day-end displays of his homeworld.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Douglas Alexander was a puffy-faced youngster with small intolerant eyes
      set in folds of fat above a button nose and a loose-lipped sensual mouth.
      There was an odd expression of defiance overlaid with fear on his pudgy
      features. Looking at him, Kennon was reminded of a frightened dog, ready
      either to bite or cower.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it wasn't Douglas who held his eye. It was the two Lani who followed
      him into the room. Every line of their bodies was perfection that spoke
      volumes about generations of breeding for physical elegance. They moved
      with a co-ordinated grace that made Douglas look even more clumsy by
      contrast. And they were identical, twin cream-and-gold works of art. They
      were completely nude&mdash;and Kennon for the first time in his life fully
      appreciated the beauty of an unclad female. To cover them would be
      sacrilege, and ornaments would only detract from their exquisite
      perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon knew that he was staring like an idiot. Alexander's amused smile
      told him that much. With an effort he composed his startled features.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair looked at him with soft violet eyes&mdash;and it was as though
      some psychic bathhouse attendant had poured ice water down his spine. For
      he had seen that look before, that liquid introspective look in the velvet
      eyes of cattle. He shivered. For a moment he had been thinking of them as
      human. And somehow the lack of that indefinable some thing called humanity
      robbed them of much of their glamour. They were still beautiful, but their
      beauty had become impersonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't take these as representative of the Lani," Alexander said suddenly.
      "They're a special case, a very special case." He glared at his cousin.
      "Damn your impudence," he said without beat. "I sent for you&mdash;not
      your toys. Send them away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas sulkily thrust out his lower lip. "You can't talk to me like that,
      Cousin Alex," he began. "I'm just a&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You head me, Douglas. Out!" Alexander's voice didn't rise but it cut like
      a whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well," Douglas said. "I can't fight you&mdash;yet." He turned to
      the humanoids. "You heard the Boss-man. Go home."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two nodded in unison and departed quickly. Somehow Kennon got the
      impression that they were happy to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just wait," Douglas said. "You can't boss me forever. Just wait. I'll
      reach my majority in five years. I can vote my shares then&mdash;and then
      I'll fix you. You won't be so high and mighty then, Mr. Big. I'll throw in
      with the rest of the Family. They don't like you too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't hold your breath waiting for the Family to help you," Alexander
      said. "They wouldn't have anyone else but me handle the finances. They
      love money too much. And until you get your inheritance remember one thing&mdash;I'm
      master here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," Douglas said, and then curiously&mdash;"Who's the oddball?"
      He gestured at Kennon with a pudgy thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our new veterinarian, Dr. Kennon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;great! Now you tell me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing like making a good first impression," Alexander said with
      ironic emphasis. "I hope he cuts you off from the Lani. He'll have the
      authority to do it, since he's taking Old Doc's place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He can't. I'm an owner. I own-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You own nothing. You're a minor. And under the terms of Grandfather's
      will, you'll own nothing except an allowance until you reach legal age.
      And that brings me to the reason I brought you here. Just when did you
      gain the right to reorganize the household staff? Just when did you get
      the power to interfere with the experimental program?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas flushed dull red and bit his lip. "Do we have to go into this in
      front of strangers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kennon's my agent," Alexander said coldly, "and he might as well learn
      about you and the others from the start."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;what do you want him to do&mdash;watch me crawl?" Douglas
      asked bitterly. "You'll make me do it. You always do. Do you want me to
      beg, to say I was wrong, to promise I won't do it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've done that already," Alexander said. "Several times. You need a
      lesson. I won't have you meddling with valuable animals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what are you going to do about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put you where you can do no more damage. As of tomorrow you'll go to
      Otpen One."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas paled. His lips quivered, and his eyes flicked uneasily as he
      watched Alexander's granite face. "You don't mean that," he said finally.
      "You're joking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never joke about business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't do that! I'll tell the Family. They won't let you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I already have their consent," Alexander said. "I obtained it after your
      last escapade. You'll be happy out there. You can play tin god all you
      like. Master of life and death on a two-acre island. No one will mind. You
      can also go to work. No one will mind that, either. And Mullins won't mind
      as long as you leave the troops alone. Now get out of here and get packed.
      You're leaving tomorrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But cousin Alex&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Move! I'm tired of the sight of you!" Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas turned and shambled out of the room. His ego was thoroughly
      deflated and he seemed more frightened than before. Obviously the Otpens
      weren't the pleasantest place in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're a military post," Alexander said. "And Commander Mullins doesn't
      like Douglas. Can't say that I blame him. Douglas is a thoroughly
      unpleasant specimen, and incidentally quite typical of the rest of the
      Family." Alexander sighed and spread his hands in a gesture that combined
      disgust and resignation. "Sometimes I wonder why I have been cursed with
      my relatives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. The implications behind the empty eyes of Douglas's Lani
      sickened him. There were several ways to produce that expression, all of
      them unpleasant. Hypnoconditioning, the Quiet Treatment, brainburning,
      transorbital leukotomy, lobectomy&mdash;all of the products of that
      diseased period of humanity's thinking when men tampered with the brains
      of other men in an effort to cure psychic states. Psychiatry had passed
      that period, at least on the civilized worlds, where even animal
      experiments were frowned upon as unnecessary cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw those two Lani," Alexander said. "Grandfather had them made that
      way as a birthday present for Douglas. He was getting senile. He died a
      year later. You'd think a man would be ashamed to keep things like that
      around&mdash;but not Douglas. He likes them." Alexander's voice was tinged
      with contempt. "He knows they disgust me&mdash;so he parades them in. I
      could strangle that pup sometimes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wondered about it. I wouldn't like to work for a man who permitted such
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was done before I took over. For the past three years there have
      been no dockings, no mutilations. I can't see treating a helpless animal
      like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel better about it," Kennon said. "I didn't think you were that
      sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Understand me," Alexander said. "I'm always opposed to senseless cruelty
      and waste&mdash;particularly when it's dangerous. Docked Lani are the
      height of stupidity. Just because someone wants a pet that is an exact
      duplicate of a human being is no reason to risk a court action. Those
      Lani, and a few others whose tails have been docked, could be a legal
      bombshell if they ever left Flora."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon was jolted. He had been thinking of mental mutilation and Alexander
      had been talking physical. Naturally they would be dangerous property.
      Anyone attempting to sell a docked Lani would probably be thrown in
      Detention and charged with slave trading.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever figure the cost of taking a legal action through our court
      system?" Alexander asked. "Even the small ones set you back four or five
      thousand, and a first-class action like a Humanity Trial could cost over a
      million. Grandfather found that out. Sure, there are differences between
      Lani and humans, but a smart lawyer can make them seem trivial until the
      final test and that would drag on for nearly two years until all the
      requirements were satisfied&mdash;and by that time the unfavorable
      publicity would drop sales to zero. The Family would be on my neck for
      lost dividends, and I'd lose much of the control I hold over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, it's possible that prehensile tails could be produced by mutation,
      but so far as we know it hasn't happened in human history. As a result,
      the tail serves as a trade-mark&mdash;something that can be easily
      recognized by anyone. So we sell them intact." Alexander crossed his legs
      and settled back in his chair. "Shocks you, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. "Yes," he admitted. "It does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. You can't help it. Most of our new employees think the Lani are
      human&mdash;at first. They learn better, but adjustment is always a
      strain. They keep confusing external appearances with the true article.
      But remember this&mdash;Lani are not human. They're animals. And on this
      island they're treated as what they are&mdash;no more, no less. They are a
      part of our economics and are bred, fed, and managed according to sound
      livestock principles. Despite some of the things you may see here in
      Alexandria, don't forget that. You are a veterinarian. Your job is to
      handle disease problems in animals. Lani are animals. Therefore you will
      be doing your job. I was disappointed in your reaction when you first saw
      them, but I suppose it was natural. At any rate this should clear the
      air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does&mdash;intellectually," Kennon admitted. "But the physical
      resemblance is so close that it is difficult to accept."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander smiled. "Don't worry. You'll accept it in time. Now I think it's
      time that you met the Family."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The main salon was crowded. The huge room, glittering with mirrors and
      crystal, floored with thick carpets, and hung with rich drapes, had
      something of the appearance of a Sarkian harem. Although there were only
      five of the Alexander family present, there were at least twenty Lani
      whose costumes ranged from the black G string and halter of the household
      staff to the utter nudity of Douglas's playthings. They were all female,
      and Kennon wondered for a moment what a male was like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides Alexander, there were two men and three women: Douglas, still with
      his sulky expression, an older man in his late nineties who looked like
      Douglas's eider brother, two mature women who could be any age from fifty
      to three hundred, and a girl. She might have been thirty&mdash;perhaps
      younger, perhaps older, a lean feminine edition of Alexander, with the
      same intriguing face and veiled predatory look. There was a hardness about
      her that was absent in the others. Kennon had the feeling that whatever
      this girl did, she didn't do it half way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister Eloise," Alexander said in a low voice. "Watch out for her.
      She's as deadly as a puff adder and she collects men. The other man is
      Douglas's father, Henry. The plump redhead beside him is his wife, Anne.
      The other woman is my mother, Clara, even though Eloise and I don't look
      like her. We take after Father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's he?" Kennon whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead," Alexander replied. "He was killed twenty years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to present Dr. Jac Kennon, our new veterinarian," Alexander said
      into the hush that followed their entrance. The introductions that
      followed were in proper form, and Kennon was beginning to feel more at
      ease until Eloise sent one of her Lani with a summons. He looked around
      for Alexander, but the entrepreneur was the center of a three-cornered
      argument, hemmed in by Douglas, Henry, and Anne. Henry's voice was raised
      in bitter protest that Alexander was exceeding his authority. He shrugged.
      There was no help there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," he said, "tell your mistress I'll be along in a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Doctor," the Lani said, "but the Woman Eloise says for you to come,
      and she is not accustomed to being disobeyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her what I said," Kennon replied. "I shall be there directly." He
      crossed to the table and examined it, selecting a cluster of odd purple
      fruit which looked more interesting than it tasted. When he had finished
      he walked leisurely over to where Eloise sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him angrily. "I am accustomed to being obeyed by my
      employees," she said coldly. Her dark eyes, oddly like her brother's,
      traversed his hard body like twin scanners.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned her appraising stare with one of his own. "I'm not your
      employee," he said bluntly. "I was hired by your brother, and there's a
      full peeper rider on my contract." His eyes traveled slowly over her
      carefully arranged hair, her make-up, her jewelry at throat and arms, her
      painted finger- and toenails, and then across the slim small-breasted
      lines of her body half revealed under her thin ankle-length tunic of
      Lyranian silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satisfied?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On Beta," he said bluntly, "your appearance would qualify you for a
      parasite camp. Six months of hard labor would do you no end of good.
      You're soft, lazy, and undisciplined."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise gasped. "Why, you&mdash;" she sputtered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And perhaps next time you'll learn to be polite," Kennon continued
      imperturbably. "After all, the superficial attributes of good breeding are
      not too hard to counterfeit."
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise, Eloise giggled. "You bite, don't you?" she asked. "Remind
      me to remember that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, your actions weren't good breeding either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admitted&mdash;but I've never pretended to be what I'm not. I'm the son
      of a spaceship skipper, and I'm a veterinarian. That's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not all. You are also a man." Her face was sober, "It's been some
      time since I've met one. I'd almost forgotten they existed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's your brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alex?&mdash;he's a money making machine. Come&mdash;sit beside me and
      let's talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;me&mdash;your job, your life&mdash;anything you wish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That line isn't exactly new," Kennon grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," she admitted, "but it usually works."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm immune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what you think." Eloise's eyes were frankly appraising. "I think I
      could become interested in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a job here. I don't think I would have time to give you the
      attention you'd demand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get bored easily. It probably wouldn't be long before I would be tired
      of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps&mdash;and perhaps not, I can't afford to take the chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem confident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget. I was a sailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And spacemen have a reputation, eh?" Eloise chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At that, you might be right. I remember the first officer of&mdash;" she
      let the thought die. "But I became tired of him," she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon smiled. "I've never had that complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you'd like to make the acid test?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," he said. "But not tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tomorrow then? Alex will be leaving in the morning. He never stays more
      than a few hours." Eloise's eyes were bright, her lips moist and red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll pick the time," Kennon said&mdash;and added to himself, "If ever."
      Despite her wealth Eloise was no different from the port-of-call girls. If
      anything, she was worse since she had enough money to implement her
      desires. They were merely in the trade for business reasons. No&mdash;Eloise
      would be something to steer clear of. Alexander was right. She was a
      mantrap. He stood up and bowed Betan fashion. "I see your brother is free
      now. He wants to brief me on my duties here. We were discussing it before
      we entered."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise pouted. "You can always do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said yourself that Alexander never stays here very long. I would be a
      poor employee if I delayed him." He grinned knowingly at her and she
      smiled back with complete understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then. Get your business done. Your pleasure can wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon steered Alexander over to an open window that led to a balcony.
      "Whew!" he said. "I see what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a tartar," Alexander agreed. "I suspect that she's a nymphomaniac."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You suspect?" Kennon asked. "By this time you should know. Let's get out
      of here. I've had about all of your sister I care to take."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't say as I blame you. I'll show you to your quarters. Maybe Old Doc
      left a bottle or two, although I suspect the old sinner hung on until the
      last one was empty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he had to put up with your relatives as a steady diet, I can't say
      that I blame him," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Careful, Doctor. You're talking about my kinfolk," Alexander said wryly.
      "At that, though, you have a point." The two men slipped quietly from the
      room. Apparently none of the Family was conscious of their departure
      except Eloise, who watched them leave with an enigmatic expression on her
      narrow face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the fortress through the rear gate and walked slowly down the
      winding path that led to the cluster of buildings in the valley below. It
      was a beautiful night, calm and clear with the stars shining down from the
      dark vault of the heavens. The constellations were strange, and Kennon
      missed the moons. Beta had three, two of which were always in the sky, but
      Kardon was moonless. Somehow it gave the sky an empty look.
    </p>
    <p>
      A damp coolness rose from the ground as the evening rain evaporated
      mistily into the still air. Kennon sniffed the odor of soil and growing
      vegetation, clean pleasant odors in contrast to what he had left. In the
      distance a bird called sleepily from one of the fortress turrets and was
      answered by some creature Kennon couldn't identify. A murmur of blended
      sound came from the valley below, punctuated by high-pitched laughter.
      Someone was singing, or perhaps chanting would be a better description.
      The melody was strange and the words unrecognizable. The thin whine of an
      atomotor in the fortress's generating plant slowly built up to a keening
      undertone that blended into the pattern of half-perceived sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice, isn't it?" Alexander remarked as they rounded another turn on the
      switchback path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You can't hear a sound from back there except for that generator.
      It's almost as though we shut those people out of existence by merely
      closing a door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish it were that simple," Alexander said. "But doors that can be
      closed can also be opened. Well&mdash;think you'll like it here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, providing I don't have to entertain your relatives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Eloise? Don't worry about her. She's as fickle as the wind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never seen anyone so frankly predatory," Kennon said. "She worries
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll all be gone tomorrow&mdash;except for Eloise," Alexander said
      with mock comfort. "Douglas is on the Otpens for a year, and the others
      are off somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be staying, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I'm afraid I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hoped you'd help me get organized. This whole thing has been something
      of a shock. I was expecting something entirely different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry&mdash;someone has to run the business. But Blalok'll brief you.
      Actually he's more qualified than I. He knows everything worth knowing
      about this place. We're going past his house in a minute&mdash;want to
      stop in and see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for Blalok. He's a Mystic&mdash;a nocturnal. He's probably doing his
      work now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps we shouldn't disturb him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense. He's used to it. I visit him frequently at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure&mdash;but you're the boss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;in a sense you are too. At least in the veterinary end of this
      business." Alexander swung sharply to the left and climbed a short flight
      of stairs that led to the nearest house. Lights flared on the deep porch,
      and the old-fashioned iris door dilated to frame the black silhouette of a
      stocky, broad-shouldered man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, sir," he said. "I was expecting you. That the new vet with
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pipeline's still working, I see," Alexander said. "Yes, this is Dr.
      Kennon&mdash;Evald Blalok&mdash;I wanted you two to meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon liked the gray middle-aged man. He looked honest and competent, a
      solid quiet man with a craggy face and the deep-set eyes of a Mystic. His
      skin had the typical thickness and pore prominence of the dwellers on that
      foggy world from which he came. But unlike the natives of Myst, his skin
      was burned a dark brown by Kardon's sun. He seemed out of place on this
      tropic world, but Kennon reflected wryly that there was probably more than
      one misplaced human here, himself included.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been going over Station Fourteen's records with Jordan," Blalok said
      as he ushered them into the house. A tall black-haired man rose as they
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Skip the formality, Jordan. Sit down," Alexander said, "and meet Dr.
      Kennon&mdash;Steve Jordan&mdash;Jordan runs the Lani Division."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded acknowledgment as Alexander continued, "What's this trouble
      at Fourteen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. We've got an epizootic of something. Another youngster died
      this morning, and there's three more that look pretty bad, jaundice, no
      appetite, complaining of muscular pains. Same symptoms as took the others.
      The one this morning makes the fourth this month, and we're only half
      through it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are all your losses in this one station?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;but it's worst there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like losses like that," Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do I," Jordan replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This isn't Jordan's fault, sir," Blalok said quickly. "As you know, we
      haven't had a vet for three months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two," Alexander corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three&mdash;Old Doc wasn't around at all the month before he died,"
      Blalok said. "As a result we've got a problem. We need professional help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well here he is&mdash;use him," Alexander said. He looked at Kennon, a
      trace of amusement on his face. "There's nothing like getting into things
      early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Particularly when one comes into them stone cold," Kennon added. "It's a
      poor way to start a career."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can't afford to wait," Jordan said. "We need help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll see what can be done," Kennon replied. "Have you saved the body?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every one of them," Jordan said. "They're in the hospital in the autopsy
      room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was sensible. A post-mortem might give us an answer. Where's the
      hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll show you," Jordan offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count me out," Alexander said. "I have a weak stomach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go along if it's necessary," Blalok said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a staff there, Old Doc trained them," Jordan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it shouldn't be necessary," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok sighed with relief and turned to Alexander. "We could check the
      records while those two are about their bloody work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather check a long strong drink," Alexander replied. "What with the
      Family and this, it's too much to take for one evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon hid a smile. Alexander had a weak spot. He was squeamish. That was
      a good thing to know.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jordan opened the door of the two-story building below Blalok's house.
      "This is it," he said, "just outside your front door. Convenient&mdash;no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too convenient," Kennon said, "also too quiet. Isn't anyone on duty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't know. Old Doc never kept the place open at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stir of movement in the darkness, the lights flashed on, and a
      sleepy-eyed Lani blinked at them in the sudden glare. She looked blankly
      at Kennon and then brightened as she saw Jordan. "What's the trouble,
      sir?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing. We want to look at the Lani I sent down this morning&mdash;Dr.
      Kennon would like to inspect the carcass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the new doctor?" the Lani asked. "Thank goodness you've come! I'll
      get the staff. I'll be back in a moment." She stepped quickly over to the
      switchboard beside the door and punched five buttons. Four more humanoids
      came into the room, followed a little later by a fifth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's the emergency?" one asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is&mdash;it's our new doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More females," Kennon muttered to himself. He turned to Jordan. "Aren't
      there any males in this crew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan stared at him with mild surprise. "No, sir&mdash;didn't you know?
      There are no male Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that," Jordan said. "Only females. There hasn't been a male on the
      island since Old Man Alexander took over. He killed them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's impossible! How do they reproduce?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever hear of artificial fertilization?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure&mdash;but that's a dead end. The offspring are haploids and they're
      sterile. The line would die out in a generation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the Lani&mdash;you can see for yourself. We've been using the
      technique here for better than four centuries, and we're still doing all
      right. Over forty generations so far, and from the looks of things we can
      go on indefinitely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how is it done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. That's Alexander's secret. The Boss-man doesn't tell us
      everything. All I know is that we get results. Old Doc knew how it was
      done, and I suppose you will too, but don't ask me. I'm dumb."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. Maybe&mdash;maybe not. At any rate there was no sense in
      belaboring the point. He turned to the staff. Five of them were the same
      big-boned heavy-framed type that apparently did most of the manual labor.
      The sixth, the late arrival, was an elegant creature, a bronze-skinned,
      green-eyed minx with an elfin face half hidden under a wavy mass of
      red-brown hair. Unlike the others, she had been docked&mdash;and in
      contrast to their heavy eyes and sleep-puffed features she was alert and
      lively. She flashed him an impish grin, revealing clean white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon smiled back. He couldn't help it. And suddenly the tension and
      strangeness was broken. He felt oddly at ease. "Which of you are on duty?"
      he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All of us," the redhead replied, "if it's necessary. What do you want us
      to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's already told me. He wants that last carcass prepped for a
      post-mortem," the nightcall Lani said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," the redhead said. "It'll be nice to get to work again." She turned
      to face Kennon. "Now, Doctor&mdash;would you like to see your office? Old
      Doc left a fine collection of notes on Lani anatomy and perhaps you could
      do with a little review."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could do with a lot of it," Kennon admitted. "Unless the inner
      structure of a Lani is as similar to human as their outer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are differences," the redhead admitted. "After all, we aren't quite
      alike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I'd better do some reading," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need me any more?" Jordan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I think not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. I'll get back. Frankly, I don't like this any better than Blalok or
      the boss, but I'm low man on that pole. See you later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled as Jordan left. "Now, let's get ready for that cadaver,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carcass, doctor," the redhead corrected. "A cadaver is a dead human
      body." She accented the "human."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in death there is no equality, Kennon thought. He nodded and the Lani
      led the way to a door which opened into a good-sized office, liberally
      covered with bookshelves. An old-fashioned plastic desk, some office
      cybernetics, a battered voicewriter, and a few chairs completed the
      furnishings. The redhead placed several large folio volumes in front of
      him and stepped back from the desk as he leafed rapidly through the color
      plates. It was an excellent atlas. Dr. Williamson had been a careful and
      competent workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, well fortified with a positional knowledge of Lani
      viscera, Kennon looked up at the redhead. She was still standing
      patiently, a statue of red-gold and bronze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get a smock and let's go," he said. "No&mdash;wait a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your name? I don't want to say 'Hey you!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. "It's Copper Glow&mdash;want my pedigree too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;it wouldn't mean anything to me. Do they call you Copper or
      Glow? or both?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just Copper, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Copper&mdash;let's get going."
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of the dead Lani lay on the steel table, waxy and yellowish in
      the pitiless light of the fluorescents. She had been hardly more than a
      child. Kennon felt a twinge of pity&mdash;so young&mdash;so young to die.
      And as he looked he was conscious of another feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been an open secret among his classmates that he had refused an
      offer to study human medicine because of his aversion to dissecting
      cadavers. The sarcoplastic models were all right, but when it came to
      flesh, Kennon didn't have the stomach for it. And now, the sight of the
      dead humanoid brought back the same cold sweat and gut-wrenching nausea
      that had caused him to turn to veterinary medicine eight years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fought the spasms back as he approached the table and made the external
      examination. Icterus and a swollen abdomen&mdash;the rest was essentially
      normal. And he knew with cold certainty that he could not lay a scalpel
      edge upon that cold flesh. It was too human, too like his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ready, Doctor?" the Lani standing across the table from him
      asked. "Shall I expose the viscera?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon's stomach froze. Of course! He should have realized! No pathologist
      did his own dissection. He examined. And that he could do. It was the
      tactile, not the visual sensations that upset him. He nodded. "The
      abdominal viscera first," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lani laid back the skin and musculature with bold, sure strokes. An
      excellent prosectress, Kennon thought. Kennon pointed at the swollen liver
      and the Lani deftly severed its attachments and laid the organ out for
      inspection. The cause of death was obvious. The youngster had succumbed to
      a massive liver-fluke infestation. It was the worst he had ever seen. The
      bile ducts were thick, calcified and choked with literally thousands of
      the gray-green leaf-shaped trematodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's look at the others," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more post-mortems confirmed the diagnosis. Except for minor
      differences, the lesions were identical. He removed a few of the flukes
      and set them aside for further study.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well that's that," he said. "You can clean up now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had found the criminal, and now the problem assumed the fascinating
      qualities of a crime hunt. Now he must act to prevent further murders, to
      reconstruct the crime, to find the modus operandi, to track the fluke to
      its source, and to execute it before it could do more harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photographs and tri-dis would have to be taken, the parasite would have to
      be identified and its sensitivity to therapy determined. Studies would
      have to be made on its life cycle, and the means by which it gained
      entrance to its host. It wouldn't be simple, because this trematode was
      probably Hepatodirus hominis, and it was tricky. It adapted, like the
      species it parasitized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon leaned back from the microscope and studied the illustrations in
      the parasitology text. No matter how much Hepatodirus changed its life
      cycle, it could not change its adult form. The arrangements of the suckers
      and genital structures were typical. Old Doc's library on parasites was
      too inadequate for more than diagnosis. He would have to wait for his own
      books to be uncrated before he could do more than apply symptomatic
      treatment. He sighed and rose slowly to his feet. Tomorrow was going to be
      a busy day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened behind him and Copper slipped quietly into the office. She
      looked at him curiously, a faint half-shy smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ready to fill out the autopsy protocol? It's customary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's also customary to knock on a door before entering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it? Old Doc never mentioned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not Old Doc."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you're not," she admitted. "You're much younger&mdash;and far more
      beautiful. Old Doc was a fat, gray old man." She paused and eyed Kennon
      appraisingly with a look on her pointed face that was the virtual twin of
      Eloise's. "I think I'll like working for you if you're as nice as you are
      pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't call a man beautiful or pretty!" Kennon exploded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It just isn't done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a funny human," she said. "I called Old Doc beautiful, and he
      didn't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's different. He was an old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What difference does that make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like it," Kennon said, hitting on the perfect answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stiffened. "I'm sorry, Doctor. I won't do it again." She looked down
      at him, head cocked sideways. "I guess I have a lot to learn about you.
      You're much different from Old Doc. He didn't snap at me." She paused for
      a moment, then drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About that report," she said. "Regulations require that each post-mortem
      be reported promptly and that a record of the Lani concerned be posted in
      the death book together with all pertinent autopsy data. Man Blalok is
      very fussy about proper records." She drew one of the chairs to a spot
      beside the desk and sat down, crossed her long legs, and waited
      expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon's mouth was suddenly dry. This situation was impossible. How in the
      name of Sir Arthur Fleming could he dictate a coldly precise report with a
      naked redhead sitting beside him? "Look," he said. "I won't need you. I
      can operate a voicewriter. You can pick up the material later and
      transcribe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face fell. "You don't like me," she said, her green eyes filling with
      quick tears. "Old Doc never&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, damn Old Doc!" Kennon snapped. "And stop that sniveling&mdash;or get
      out. Better yet&mdash;get out and stop sniveling!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaped to her feet and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon swore. There was no reason for him to act that way. He had been
      more brutal than necessary. But the girl&mdash;no, the Lani&mdash;was
      disconcerting. He felt ashamed of himself. He had behaved like a primitive
      rather than a member of one of the oldest human civilizations in the
      galaxy. He wouldn't bark at a dog that way. He shook his head. Probably he
      was tired. Certainly he was irritable, and unclad females virtually
      indistinguishable from human weren't the most soothing objects to
      contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if his exasperation was real or merely a defense mechanism.
      First Eloise, and then this! Confound it! He was surrounded! He felt
      trapped. And it wasn't because he'd been away from women too long. A week
      was hardly that. He grinned as he recalled the blonde from Thule aboard
      the starship. Now there was a woman, even though her ears were pointed and
      her arms were too long. She didn't pressure a man. She let him make the
      advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grinned. That was it. He was on the defensive. He was the one who was
      being pursued&mdash;and his male ego had revolted. He shrugged and turned
      his attention to the autopsy report, but it was hopeless. He couldn't
      concentrate. He jotted a few notes and dropped them on the desk&mdash;tomorrow
      would be time enough. What he needed now was a stiff drink and eight
      hours' sleep.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kennon stopped at Blalok's house long enough to tell the superintendent
      what was causing the trouble. Blalok scowled. "We've never had flukes here
      before," he said. "Why should they appear now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've been introduced," Kennon said. "The thing that bothers me is how
      Dr. Williamson missed them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old man was senile," Blalok said. "He was nearly blind the last six
      months of his life. I wouldn't doubt that he let his assistants do most of
      his work, and they could have missed them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly, but the lesions are easy to see. At any rate, the culprit is
      known now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Culprit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hepatodirus hominis&mdash;the human liver fluke. He's a tricky little
      fellow&mdash;travels almost as far as men do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad it's your problem, not mine. All I can remember about flukes is
      that they're hard to eradicate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Particularly H. hominis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can tell me about it later. Right now Mr. Alexander's over at Old&mdash;your
      house. Probably he's looking for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Jordan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He went up to Station Fourteen. We'll see him tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll say good night then," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you're here. It's a load off my shoulders. See you tomorrow."
      Blalok waved a friendly good night and left the lights on long enough for
      Kennon to make his way to his quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander was seated in a heavily upholstered chair listening to a taped
      symphony in the stereo, his eyes half closed, an expression of peace on
      his face. An elderly Lani stood beside him. It was a comfortable picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The humanoid saw Kennon and gasped, a tiny indrawn sound of surprise.
      Alexander's eyes snapped open. "Oh&mdash;it's you," he said. "Don't worry,
      Kara&mdash;it's your new doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kara smiled. "You startled me," she said. "I was dreaming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On your feet?" Alexander interjected idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have known you at once, Doctor. There's talk about you all over
      the yards, ever since you arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They know what is going on around here better than any of us," Alexander
      chuckled. "The grapevine is amazingly efficient. Well&mdash;what's the
      story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liver fluke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hmm&mdash;not good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it can be stopped. I looked at the records. It doesn't seem to
      have been here too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you're right. How long will it take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Several months, maybe a year, maybe more. I can't say. But I'll try to
      clean it up as quickly as possible. I'm pretty sure of the fluke, and it's
      a hard one to control."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hepatodirus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's an offworld parasite, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It originated on Santos. Parasitized the Varl originally, but liked
      humans better. It's adapted to a hundred different planetary environments,
      and it keeps spreading. It's a real cutie&mdash;almost intelligent the way
      it behaves. But it can be licked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good&mdash;get on it right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm starting tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine&mdash;I thought you'd be the right man. Kara! Fix the doctor a
      drink. We might as well have a nightcap&mdash;then I'll go back to the
      house and listen to Henry and Anne's screams about poor mistreated
      Douglas, and then back to Albertsville tomorrow. Duty and the credits
      call."
    </p>
    <p>
      With mild surprise, Kennon realized that Alexander was drunk. Not
      obnoxiously, but enough to change his character. Intoxicated, he was a
      friendlier person. If there was any truth in the ancient cliche about
      alcohol bringing out a man's true character, then Alexander was basically
      a very nice person indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;here's your home for the next five years," Alexander said.
      "Eight rooms, two baths, a freshener, and three Lani to keep the place
      running. You've got it made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps&mdash;we'll see when we tackle this fluke infestation.
      Personally, I don't think I'm going to have an easy time. Tomorrow I'm
      going to be up to my neck in trouble trying to save your profits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll do it. I have confidence in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I still think you should have hired a medic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This isn't all of your job," Alexander said. "And besides I can't afford
      to do it. Oh&mdash;not the money, but it might be admitting that the Lani
      might be human. And we've gone to a great deal of trouble to prove they're
      not." He shifted uncomfortably in his chair. "There's a story behind
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't doubt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe it'd be better if I told it. It goes back over four centuries.
      Grandfather was a clever man. After he had secured this island he became
      worried about the surviving Lani. He didn't want to be accused of
      genocide, since the Lani were so human in appearance. So he had his
      medical officer make a few autopsies. The M.D. reported that while there
      was similarity, the Lani were probably not human.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was enough for Grandfather. He requested a Court of Inquiry. The
      court was sitting in Halsey and the hearing was private. Even so, it
      leaked and Grandfather was highly unpopular for a time until the lab
      reports came in. It cost him over eight hundred Ems and nearly two years'
      time to finish the case, but when it was over the Lani were declared
      alien, and Grandfather had ironclad discovery rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They really put him through the mill. Grandfather furnished the bodies
      and three court-appointed M.O.'s went through them with microscopes. They
      didn't miss a thing. Their reports are so detailed that they're classics
      of their kind. They're almost required reading for anyone who wants to
      learn Lani structure and function. The court rendered an interim decision
      that the Lani were nonhuman, and armed with this, Grandfather prepared the
      final tests which were run by a team of court-appointed medics and
      biologists, who made in vitro and live tests on a number of Lani female
      prisoners. The tests ran for over two years and were totally negative. So
      the Alexander family acquired Flora and the Otpens, and a legal status."
      Alexander stood up. "Well&mdash;that's a capsule summary. The records are
      in the library if you'd care to check them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just to prove we're honest." He moved carefully toward the door, opened
      it, and disappeared into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently Kennon watched him descend the porch steps. He seemed steady
      enough. For a moment Kennon debated whether he should see him home&mdash;and
      then decided against it. If Alexander needed help he'd have asked for it.
      As it was, it was better to leave things alone. Certainly he didn't know
      Alexander well enough to act as a guardian. He turned back to the living
      area. The stereo was playing something soft and nostalgic as Kennon sank
      into the chair Alexander had vacated. He let his body relax. It had been
      as full a day as he had ever spent filled with changes so abrupt that they
      were exhausting. He felt confused. There were no precedents he could
      apply. Neither his studies nor his travels had prepared him for living in
      a situation like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legally and biologically the Lani weren't human. But they were
      intelligent, upright, bipedal mammals whose morphology was so close to
      man's that it had taken the ultimate test to settle their status. And
      being a Betan, Kennon was suspicious of the accuracy of that ultimate
      test.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Brotherhood of Man was based upon it. The feeling of unity that
      pervaded mankind's expanding empire was its product. From almost the
      beginning of mankind's leap to the stars it had been recognized that men
      must help each other or perish. The spirit of co-operation against the
      common enmity of alien worlds and cultures transcended the old petty
      rivalries on Earth. Men&mdash;all men&mdash;were brothers in arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the Brotherhood was born&mdash;and the concept born of necessity
      developed its muscles in a thousand battles on a thousand hostile worlds.
      And ultimately it evolved into the only form of central authority that men
      would accept. Yet basically it was not a government. It was an attitude of
      mind. Men accepted its decisions as they would accept the rulings of a
      family council, and for the same reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brotherhood laid down certain rules but it did not attempt to enforce
      them. After all, it didn't need to. It also arbitrated disputes, admitted
      new worlds to membership, and organized concerted human effort against
      dangerous enemies. And that was all. Yet in its sphere the authority of
      the Brotherhood was absolute.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one criterion for membership in the Brotherhood&mdash;membership
      in the human race. No matter how decadent or primitive a population might
      be, if it was human it was automatically eligible for Brotherhood&mdash;a
      free and equal partner in the society of human worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon doubted that any nonhuman race had ever entered the select circle
      of humanity, although individuals might have done so. A docked Lani, for
      instance, would probably pass unquestioned as a human, but the Lani race
      would not. In consequence they and their world were fair prey, and had
      been attacked and subjugated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, proof of inhumanity was seldom a problem. Most alien life forms
      were obviously alien. But there were a few&mdash;like the Lani&mdash;where
      similarities were so close that it was impossible to determine their
      status on the basis of morphology alone. And so the Humanity Test had come
      into being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Essentially it was based upon species compatibility&mdash;on the concept
      that like can interbreed with like. Tests conducted on every inhabited
      world in the Brotherhood had proven this conclusively. Whatever changes
      had taken place in the somatic characteristics of mankind since the
      Exodus, they had not altered the compatibility of human germ plasm. Man
      could interbreed with man&mdash;aliens could not. The test was simple. The
      results were observable. And what was more important, everyone could
      understand it. No definition of humanity could be more simple or direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      But was it accurate?
    </p>
    <p>
      Like other Betans, Kennon wondered. It was&mdash;so far&mdash;probably.
      The qualifying phrases were those of the scientist, that strange breed
      that refuses to accept anything as an established fact until it is proven
      beyond a shadow of a doubt. After all, the human race had been spaceborne
      for only six thousand years&mdash;scarcely time for any real differences
      to develop. But physical changes had already appeared&mdash;and it would
      only be a question of time before these would probably be followed by
      genetic changes. And in some groups the changes might be extensive enough
      to make them genetic strangers to the rest of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would happen then? No one knew. Actually no one bothered to think
      about it except for a few far-seeing men who worried as they saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four words. But because of them the Betans were slowly withdrawing from
      the rest of humanity. Already the radiations of Beta's variant-G sun had
      produced changes in the population. Little things like tougher epidermis
      and depilation of body hair&mdash;little things that held alarming
      implications to Beta's scientists, and to Beta's people. Not too many
      generations hence a Betan outside his home system would be a rarity, and
      in a few millennia the Betan system itself would be a closed enclave
      peopled by humans who had deviated too far from the basic stock to mingle
      with it in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the Brotherhood itself might be changed by that time, but there
      was no assurance that this would happen. And mankind had a history of
      dealing harshly with its mutants. So Beta would play it safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon wondered if there were other worlds in the Brotherhood that had
      come to the same conclusion. Possibly there were. And possibly there were
      worlds where marked deviations had occurred. There wasn't a year that
      passed that didn't bring some new human world into the Brotherhood, and
      many of these had developed from that cultural explosion during the First
      Millennium known as the Exodus, where small groups of colonists in
      inadequate ships set out for unannounced goals to homestead new worlds for
      man. Some of these survived, and many were being discovered even at this
      late date. But so far none had any difficulty in proving their human
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lani, conceivably, could have been descendants of one of these groups,
      which probably explained the extreme care the Brotherhood courts had taken
      with their case. But they had failed the test, and were declared animals.
      Yet it was possible that they had mutated beyond genetic compatibility. If
      they had, and if it were proved, here was a test case that could rock the
      galaxy&mdash;that could shake the Brotherhood to its very foundations&mdash;that
      could force a re-evaluation of the criteria of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon grinned. He was a fine employee. Here he was, less than a full day
      on the job, dreaming how he could ruin his employer, shake the foundation
      of human civilization, and force ten thousand billion humans to change
      their comfortable habit patterns and their belief in the unchangeable
      sameness of men. He was, he reflected wryly, an incurable romantic.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Wake up, Doctor, it's six A.M." A pleasant voice cut through Kennon's
      slumber. He opened one eye and looked at the room. For a moment the
      strange surroundings bothered him, then memory took over. He stirred
      uncomfortably, looking for the owner of the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have your morning calls at seven, and there's a full day ahead," the
      voice went on. "I'm sorry, sir, but you should get up." The voice didn't
      sound particularly sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was behind him, Kennon decided. He rolled over with a groan of protest
      and looked at his tormentor. A gasp of dismay left his lips, for standing
      beside the bed, a half smile on her pointed face, was Copper&mdash;looking
      fresh and alert and as disturbing as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't right, Kennon thought bitterly, to be awakened from a sound
      sleep by a naked humanoid who looked too human for comfort. "What are you
      doing here?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm supposed to be here," Copper said. "I'm your secretary." She grinned
      and flexed a few curves of her torso.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything wrong?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Kennon was tempted to tell her what was wrong&mdash;but he
      held his tongue. She probably wouldn't understand. But there was one thing
      he'd better settle right now. "Now look here, young lady&mdash;" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a lady," Copper interrupted before he could continue. "Ladies are
      human. I'm a Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," Kennon growled. "Lani or human, who cares? But do you have to
      break into a man's bedroom and wake him in the middle of the night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't break in," she said, "and it isn't the middle of the night. It's
      morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;so it's morning and you didn't break in. Then how in
      Halstead's sacred name did you get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sleep next door," she said jerking a thumb in the direction of an open
      door in the side wall. "I've been there ever since you dismissed me last
      night," she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation left Kennon cold. The old cliche about doing as the
      Santosians do flicked through his mind. Well, perhaps he would in time&mdash;but
      not yet. The habits of a lifetime couldn't be overturned overnight. "Now
      you have awakened me," he said, "perhaps you'll get out of here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to get dressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll help you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not! I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I've been
      dressing myself for years. I'm not used to people helping me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My&mdash;what a strange world you must come from. Haven't you ever had a
      Lani before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You poor man." Her voice was curiously pitying. "No one to make you feel
      like the gods. No one to serve you. No one to even scrub your back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough," Kennon said. "I can scrub my own back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?&mdash;you can't reach it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weren't there any Lani on your world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No wonder you left it. It must be quite primitive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Primitive!" Kennon's voice was outraged. "Beta has one of the highest
      civilizations in the Brotherhood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you don't have Lani," she said patiently. "So you must be primitive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halstead, Fleming, and Ochsner!" Kennon swore. "Do you believe that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally, isn't it obvious? You can't possibly be civilized unless you
      take responsibility for intelligent life other than your own race. Until
      you face up to your responsibilities you are merely a member of a dominant
      race, not a civilized one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon's reply caught in his throat. His eyes widened as he looked at her,
      and what he was about to say remained unspoken. "Out of the mouths of
      humanoids&mdash;" he muttered oddly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean?" Copper asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forget it," Kennon said wildly. "Leave me alone. Go put on some clothes.
      You embarrass me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go," Copper said, "but you'll have to be embarrassed. Only household
      Lani wear cloth." She frowned, two vertical furrows dividing her dark
      brows. "I've never understood why inhouse Lani have to be disfigured that
      way, but I suppose there's some reason for it. Men seldom do anything
      without a reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. Either she was grossly ignorant, which he doubted,
      or she was conditioned to the eyeballs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was more probable. But even that was doubtful. Her trenchant
      remark about civilization wasn't the product of a conditioned mind. But
      why was he worrying about her attitudes? They weren't important&mdash;she
      wasn't even human. He shook his head. That was a sophistry. The fact that
      she wasn't human had nothing to do with the importance of her attitude. "I
      suppose there is a reason," he agreed. "But I don't know it. I haven't
      been here long enough to know anything about such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "That does make a difference," she admitted. "Many new men are
      bothered at first by the fact that we Lani are naked, but they adjust
      quickly. So will you." She smiled as she turned away. "You see," she added
      over her shoulder as she left the room, "we're not human. We're just
      another of your domestic animals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there laughter in her voice? Kennon wasn't sure. His sigh was composed
      of equal parts of relief and exasperation as he slipped out of bed and
      began to dress. He'd forgo the shower this morning. He had no desire for
      Copper to appear and offer to scrub his back. In his present state of mind
      he couldn't take it. Possibly he'd get used to it in time. Perhaps he
      might even like it. But right now he wasn't acclimatized.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man Blalok called," Copper said as she removed the breakfast dishes. "He
      said that he'd be right over to pick you up. He wants to show you the
      operation." "When did he call?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About ten minutes ago. I told him that you were at breakfast. He said
      he'd wait." She disappeared in the direction of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a nightmare quality to this," Kennon muttered as he slipped his
      arms into the sleeves of his tunic and closed the seam tabs. "I have the
      feeling that I'm going to wake up any minute." He looked at his reflection
      in the dresser mirror, and his reflection looked worriedly back. "This
      whole thing has an air of plausible unreality: the advertisement, the
      contract, this impossible island that raises humanoids as part of the
      livestock." He shrugged and his mirrored image shrugged back. "But it's
      real, all right. No dream could possibly be this detailed. I wonder how
      I'm going to take it for the next five years? Probably not too well," he
      mused silently. "Already I'm talking to myself. Without even trying, that
      Lani Copper can make me feel like a Sarkian." He nodded at his image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sarkian analogy was almost perfect, he decided. For on that grimly
      backward world females were as close to slaves as the Brotherhood would
      permit; raised from birth under an iron regimen designed to produce
      complaisant mates for the dominant males. Probably that was the reason
      Sark was so backward. The men, having achieved domestic tranquillity, had
      no desire to do anything that would disturb the status quo. And since no
      Sarkian woman under any conceivable circumstances would annoy her lordly
      master with demands to produce better mousetraps, household gadgetry, and
      more money, the technological development of Sark had come to a virtual
      standstill. It took two sexes to develop a civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. Worlds developed as they did because people were as they
      were, and while passing judgment was still a major human pursuit, no
      native of one world had a right to force his customs down the unwilling
      throat of another. It would be better to accept his present situation and
      live with it rather than trying to impose his Betan conception of morality
      upon Lani that neither understood nor appreciated it. His business was to
      treat and prevent animal disease. What happened to the animals before
      infection or after recovery was none of his affair. That was a matter
      between Alexander and his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok was waiting for him, sitting behind the wheel of a square boxy
      vehicle that squatted with an air of unpolished efficiency on the graveled
      drive behind his house. He smiled a quick greeting as Kennon approached.
      "It's about time you showed up," he said. "You'll have to get into the
      habit of rising early on this place. We do most of our work early in the
      morning and late in the afternoon. During the day it's too hot to breathe,
      let alone work. Well, let's get going. There's still time to visit the
      outer stations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon climbed in and Blalok started the vehicle. "I thought we'd take a
      jeep today," he said. "They aren't very pretty, but they get around." He
      turned onto the surfaced road that ran down the hill toward the hospital
      and the complex of red-roofed buildings clustered about it. "About those
      flukes," he said. "You have any plans to get rid of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet. I'll have to look the place over. There's more detective work
      than medicine involved in this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Detective work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure&mdash;we know the criminal, but to squelch him we have to learn his
      hangouts, study his modus operandi, and learn how to make his victims
      secure from his activities. Unless we do that, we can treat individuals
      from now to infinity and all we'll have is more cases. We have to apply
      modern criminology tactics&mdash;eliminate the source of crime&mdash;stop
      up the soft spots. In other words, kill the flukes before they enter the
      Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Doc never said anything about this," Blalok said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably he never knew about it. I was looking over the herd books last
      night, and I saw nothing about trematodes, or anything that looked like a
      parasite pattern until the last few months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My guess is that he was one of the first deaths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean this thing attacks human beings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preferentially," Kennon said. "It's strange, too, because it originated
      on Santos so far as we know. In fact, some people think that the Varl bred
      it for a weapon to use against us before we conquered them. They could
      have done it. Their biological science was of a high enough order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did it get here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't know&mdash;unless you've hired a Santosian or someone else who
      was affected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We did have a man from Santos. Fellow called Joe Kryla. We had to let him
      go because he was a nudist. It made a bad impression on the Lani. But that
      was over a year ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about the right time to build up a good reservoir of infection.
      The fatal cases usually don't show up before an area is pretty well
      seeded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not so good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's one thing in our favor. The Lani are pretty well
      concentrated into groups. And so far there doesn't seem to be any
      infestation outside of Hillside Station&mdash;except for two deaths in
      Lani recently sent from there. If we quarantine those stations and work
      fast, may be we can stop this before it spreads all over the island."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's fine, but what are you going to do now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treat those that show symptoms. There should be some Trematox capsules at
      the hospital. If there aren't we'll get them. We'll take the sick ones
      back to the hospital area and push therapy and supportive treatment. Now
      that we know the cause, we shouldn't have any more death losses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Doc didn't treat at the hospital," Blalok said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not Old Doc."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's going to mess up our operations. We're using the ward buildings
      to finish training the Lani scheduled for market."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's convenient. Most of the ward space is filled right now." Blalok
      said. There was a touch of disgust in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're well, aren't they?" Kennon demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then get them out of there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I told you-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me nothing. The hospital area is needed for something more than
      a training center. Perhaps Old Doc was trained in outcall work, but I'm
      not. I work from a hospital. The only things I do on outcalls are
      diagnoses, vaccinations, and emergencies. The rest of the patients come to
      the hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This isn't going to set well with Jordan and the division chiefs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not my concern," Kennon said. "I run my business in the best way
      possible. The patients are of more concern than the personal comfort of
      any straw boss or administrator. You're the administrator&mdash;you calm
      them down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the authority," Blalok admitted. "But my advice to you is to go
      slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't," Kennon said. "Not if we want to prevent any more losses. There
      simply won't be time to run all over the island dosing with Trematox and
      taking temperatures, and while that sort of thing is routine, it should be
      supervised. Besides, you'll see the advantages of this method. Soon
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," Blalok said as he braked the jeep to a stop in front of the
      hospital. "I suppose you'll want to take some things along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I will," Kennon said. "I'll be back in a minute." Kennon slid from the
      seat, leaving Blalok looking peculiarly at his departing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minute stretched to nearly ten before Kennon returned followed by two
      Lani carrying bags which they loaded into the back of the jeep. "I had to
      reorganize a little," Kennon apologized, "some things were unfamiliar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plan on taking them?" Blalok said, jerking a thumb at the two Lani.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not this time. I'm having them fit up an ambulance. They should be busy
      most of the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok grunted and started the turbine. He moved a lever and the jeep
      floated off the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An airboat too," Kennon remarked. "I wondered why this rig was so boxy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a multipurpose vehicle," Blalok said. "We need them around here for
      fast transport. Most of the roads aren't so good." He engaged the drive
      and the jeep began to move. "We'll go cross country," he said. "Hillside's
      pretty far out&mdash;the farthest station since we abandoned Olympus."
    </p>
    <p>
      The air began whistling past the boxlike body of the jeep as Blalok
      increased the power to the drive and set the machine on automatic. "We'll
      get a pretty good cross-section of our operations on this trip," he said
      over the whine of the turbine. "Look down there."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were passing across a series of fenced pastures and Kennon was
      impressed. The size of this operation was beginning to sink in. It hadn't
      looked so big from the substratosphere in Alexander's ship, but down here
      close to the ground it was enormous. Fields of grain, wide orchards,
      extensive gardens. Once they were forced to detour a huge supply boat that
      rose heavily in front of them. Working in the fields were dozens of
      brown-skinned Lani who paused to look up and wave as the jeep sped by.
      Occasional clusters of farm buildings and the low barrackslike stations
      appeared and disappeared behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's about twenty Lani at each of these stations," Blalok said, "They
      work the farm area under the direction of the stationmaster."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a farmer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Usually he's a graduate of an agricultural school, but we have
      a few who are descendants of the crew of the first Alexander, and there's
      one old codger who was actually with him during the conquest. Most of our
      stationmasters are family men. We feel that a wife and children add to a
      man's stability&mdash;and incidentally keep him from fooling around with
      the Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      A series of fenced pastures containing hundreds of huge grayish-white
      quadrupeds slipped past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cattle?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Earth strain. That's why they're so big. We also have sheep and
      swine, but you won't see them on this run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any native animals?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few&mdash;and some which are native to other worlds. But they're
      luxury-trade items. The big sale items are beef, pork, and mutton." Blalok
      chuckled. "Did you think that the Lani were our principal export?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're only a drop in the bucket. Agriculture&mdash;Earth-style
      agriculture&mdash;is our main source of income. The Lani are valuable
      principally to keep down the cost of overhead. Virtually all of them work
      right here on the island. We don't sell more than a hundred a year less
      than five per cent of our total. And those are surplus&mdash;too light or
      too delicate for farm work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you find a market for all this produce?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's two hundred million people here, and quite a few billion more in
      space-train range. We can produce more cheaply than any competitor, and we
      can undersell any competition, even full automation." Blalok chuckled.
      "There are some things that a computer can't do as well as a human being,
      and one of them is farm the foods on which humanity is accustomed to feed.
      A man'll pay two credits for a steak. He could get a Chlorella substitute
      for half a credit, but he'll still buy the steak if he can afford it. Same
      thing goes for fruit, vegetables, grain, and garden truck. Man's eating
      habits have only changed from necessity. Those who can pay will still pay
      well for natural foods." Blalok chuckled. "We've put quite a dent in the
      algae and synthetics operations in this sector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's still a luxury trade," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've eaten synthetic," Blalok replied. "What do you prefer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon had to agree that Blalok was right. He, too, liked the real thing
      far better than its imitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it's this profitable, then why sell Lani?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the Family's idea. Actually&mdash;since the export type is surplus
      it does us no harm. We keep enough for servants&mdash;and the others would
      be inefficient for most farm work. So disposal by sale is a logical and
      profitable way of culling. But now the Boss-man is being pressured into
      breeding an export type. And this I don't like. It's too commercial.
      Smells like slavery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a Mystic, aren't you?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure&mdash;but that doesn't mean I like slavery. Oh, I know some of those
      fatheaded Brotherhood economists call our system economic slavery&mdash;and
      I'll admit that it's pretty hard to crack out of a spherical trust. But
      that doesn't mean that we have to stay where we are. Mystics aren't owned
      by their entrepreneurs. Sure, it's a tough haul to beat the boss, but it
      can be done. I did it, and others do it all the time. The situation isn't
      hopeless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is with the Lani," Kennon added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. That's why they should be protected. What chance does a Lani
      have? Without us they can't even keep going as a race. They're
      technological morons. They don't live long enough to understand modern
      civilization. To turn those poor helpless humanoids out into human society
      would be criminal. It's our duty to protect them even while we're using
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man's burden?' Kennon said, repeating the old cliche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly." Blalok scowled. "I wish I had guts enough to give the Boss-man
      the facts&mdash;but I can't get nerve enough to try. I've a good job here&mdash;a
      wife and two kids&mdash;and I don't want to jeopardize my future." Blalok
      glanced over the side. "Well, here we are," he said, and began descending
      into the center of a spokelike mass of buildings radiating outward from a
      central hub.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hmm&mdash;big place," Kennon murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It should be," Blalok replied. "It furnishes all of our Lani for
      replacement and export. It can turn out over a thousand a year at full
      capacity. Of course we don't run at that rate, or Flora would be
      overpopulated. But this is a big layout, like you said. It can maintain a
      population of at least forty thousand. Old Alexander had big ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what he planned to do with them?" Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't know. The Old Man never took anyone into his confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan came up as the jeep settled to the ground. "Been expecting you for
      the past half hour," he said. "Your office said you were on your way.&mdash;Good
      to see you, too, Doc. I've been going over the records with Hank Allworth&mdash;the
      stationmaster here." Jordan held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're an Earthman, eh?" Kennon asked as he grasped the outstretched
      hand. The gesture was as old as man, its ritualistic meaning lost in
      antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;Marsborn&mdash;a neighbor world," Jordan said. "But our customs
      and Earth's are the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a long way from home," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No farther than you, Doc." Jordan looked uncomfortable. "But we can
      compare origins later. Right now, you'd better come into the office. I've
      run across something peculiar."

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      "There are twelve bays to this station," Jordan said. "Under our present
      setup two are used for breeding and the other ten for maturation. We
      rotate the youngsters around the bay&mdash;a different bay each year until
      they're age eleven. Then they're sorted according to type and sent out for
      a year of further specialized training after which they go onto the farms,
      or to inhouse or export.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now here's the peculiar part. There's no trouble in Bays One through
      Nine, but Bay Ten has had all our losses except two that have occurred at
      the training stations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good news," Kennon said. "Our parasite can't have had time to
      migrate too far. We have him pinpointed unless&mdash;say how many training
      centers are there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three," Jordan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quarantine them," Kennon replied. "Right now. Nothing goes in or out
      until we've checked them and completed prophylaxis."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan looked at Blalok inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's the boss," Blalok said. "Do as you're told. This is his problem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the quarantine?" Jordan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to get any carriers. We can check them with antigen, and then give
      Trematox."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that concentration in Bay Ten," Jordan said. "Does it mean
      something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blalok said that there was a Santosian in your division."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yeah&mdash;Joe Kryla&mdash;and come to think of it, he ran Bay Ten!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a help&mdash;now let's see what makes that bay different from the
      others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you&mdash;but you may not understand," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take a chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon grinned. "All right, you asked for it. The parasite that's doing
      the damage is a flatworm, a trematode called Hepatodirus hominis. As I've
      told Blalok, it's a tricky thing. Like all trematodes it has a three-stage
      life cycle, but unlike every other fluke, its life cycle is not fixed to
      definite intermediate hosts. Depending upon where it is, the fluke adapts.
      It still must pass through its life cycle, but its intermediate host need
      not be one species of snail, fish, or copepod. Any cold-blooded host will
      do. What you have here is a Kardonian variant which has adapted to some
      particular intermediate host on this world. Until now, its final host was
      either man or Varl. Now we have a third, the Lani. And apparently they are
      the most susceptible of the three. It never kills Varl. And humans, while
      they're more susceptible, only occasionally succumb, but the Lani appear
      to be the most susceptible of all. I've never seen an infestation like
      those Lani had. Their livers were literally crawling with flukes." Kennon
      paused and looked at Jordan. "You following me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slowly and poorly," Jordan said. "You're assuming too much knowledge on
      my part."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "You can't say I didn't warn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;I'm really interested in only one thing&mdash;how do you break
      the parasite up in business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's only one sure way&mdash;and that's to break the life cycle. The
      technique is thousands of years old, but it's just as good today as it was
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good&mdash;then let's do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To make a varrit stew," Kennon said, "one must first catch the varrit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to learn the beastie's life cycle before we can break it, and
      like I said, it adapts. Its intermediate host can be any one of a hundred
      cold-blooded animals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no place else where it can be attacked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, in the body of the final host, or on its final encysting place. But
      that won't eliminate the bug."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll still survive in its infective form and enough Lani will get
      subacute dosage to propagate it until the time is right for another
      epizootic. We have to kill its intermediate host&mdash;or hosts if it has
      more than one. That will keep it from growing and will ultimately
      eradicate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Judson scratched his head. "It sounds complicated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. It's so complicated that once the fluke becomes well established
      it's virtually impossible to eradicate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think it can be done here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can give it the old college try. But it's going to take some detective
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do we start?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Bay Ten. We look it over real well. Then we check the diet and
      habits of the Lani. Then we check each individual Lani. Then we check the
      life cycle of the parasite. Somewhere along the line if we're lucky we'll
      find a weak point that can be attacked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a big order," Blalok said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be helped. That's the way it is. Of course, we're lucky that
      we're on an isolated land mass. That gives us an advantage. We should be
      able to clean this up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long do you think it will take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends on how well the fluke is established. Six months at the
      minimum&mdash;and I wouldn't care to guess at the maximum. However, I hope
      the minimum will be time enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," Blalok said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," Kennon said, "let's get on with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it won't interrupt our program," Jordan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it will interrupt it," Kennon replied. "It can't help it. Get
      the idea in your head that you're facing something here that can cripple
      you&mdash;maybe abort your whole operation. You have a choice&mdash;interrupt
      now or abort later. And half measures won't work. To eradicate this pest
      requires an all-out effort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't see why we can't merely bypass Bay Ten&mdash;" Jordan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take my word for it," Kennon said. "You can't. There's no accurate way of
      telling how far this spreads until the death losses occur. Our tests for
      fluke infestation aren't that good. We have to work thoroughly and
      carefully. We can't be butting heads over this&mdash;either we all
      co-operate or this whole operation will blow up in our faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the record. Six months ago you ended a year with no deaths from
      disease. Five months ago Old Doc and two Lani were ill. Four months ago
      one of the two Lani was dead and Old Doc was too ill to be effective.
      Three months ago Old Doc and the other Lani were dead, and before the end
      of the month two more followed them. Two months ago six died, last month
      eight, and so far this month you've lost four and you have over two weeks
      to go. Up to now they've all been from here, but two this month were at
      other stations. In six months if nothing is done, we'll be having losses
      there unless we're lucky. And the losses will keep on increasing.
      Apparently you don't know what it is to live with parasites&mdash;so let
      me tell you. It isn't pleasant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok shrugged. "You needn't get hot about it," he said. "After all,
      you're the Doc&mdash;and we'll co-operate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan nodded. "We will," he said. "All the way."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a special providence that looks over recent veterinary graduates,
      Kennon reflected as he checked the monthly reports from the Stations.
      Since the time he had laid down the law to Judson and Blalok, he had had
      no trouble from the production staff. And for the past four months there
      had been no further trouble with Hepatodirus. That unwanted visitor had
      apparently been evicted. At that, they had been lucky. The parasite had
      been concentrated at Hillside Station and had failed to establish itself
      in the training area. The intermediate host, it had turned out, was a
      small amphibian that was susceptible to commercial insecticide. It had
      been no trouble to eradicate. Systemic treatment and cooking of all food
      had cleaned up the infective cercaria and individual infections, and after
      six months of intensive search, quarantine, and investigation, Kennon was
      morally certain that the disease had been eradicated. The last four
      reports confirmed his belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed as he leaned back in his chair. Blalok was at last convinced
      that his ideas were right. The hospital was operating as a hospital
      should, with a staff of twelve Lani kept busy checking the full wards.
      Actually, it was working better than it should, since stationmasters all
      over the island were now shipping in sick animals rather than treating
      them or requesting outpatient service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, Doc," Blalok said as he pushed the door open and looked into the
      office. "You doing anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at the moment," Kennon said. "Something troubling you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;just thought I'd drop in for a moment and congratulate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For surviving the first year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That won't be for two months yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok shook his head. "This is Kardon," he said. "There's only three
      hundred and two days in our year, ten thirty-day months and two special
      days at the year's end."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. "My contract is Galactic Standard. I still have two
      months to go. But how come the ten-month year? Most other planets have
      twelve, regardless of the number of days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Alexander liked thirty-day months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've wondered about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll find a lot more peculiar things about Flora when you get to know
      her better. This year has just been a breaking-in period."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "It's damn near broken me," he admitted. "You know, I
      thought that the Lani'd be my principal practice when I came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't figure that right. They're the easiest part. They're
      intelligent and co-operative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is more than one can say about the others." Kennon wiped the sweat
      from his face. "What with this infernal heat and their eternal
      stubbornness, I've nearly been driven crazy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't have laid out that vaccination program."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to. Your hog business was living mostly on luck, and the sheep and
      shrakes were almost as bad. You can't get away from soil saprophytes no
      matter how clean you are. Under a pasture setup there's always a chance of
      contamination. And that old cliche about an ounce of prevention is truer
      of livestock raising than anything else I can think of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have some more good news for you," Blalok said. "That's why I came
      over. We're going to have another species to treat and vaccinate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon groaned. "Now what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poultry." Blalok's voice was disgusted. "Personally I think it's a mess,
      but Alexander thinks it's profitable. Someone's told him that pound for
      pound chickens are the most efficient feed converters of all the domestic
      animals. So we're getting a pilot plant: eggs, incubator, and a
      knocked-down broiler battery so we can try the idea out. The Boss-man is
      always hot on new ideas to increase efficiency and production. The only
      trouble is that he fails to consider the work involved in setting up
      another operation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're so right. I'll have to brush up on pullorum, ornithosis,
      coccidosis, leukosis, perosis, and Ochsner knows how many other-osises and&mdash;itises.
      I was never too strong on fowl practice in school, and I'd be happier if I
      never had anything to do with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So would I," Blalok agreed. "I can't see anything in this but trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he's forgotten something else," Blalok added. "Poultry need
      concentrated feed. We're going to have to install a feed mill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "I hope he'll appreciate the bill he gets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thinks we can use local labor," Blalok said gloomily. "I wish he'd
      realize that Lani are technological morons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They could learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so&mdash;but it isn't easy. And besides, Allworth is the only
      man with feed-mill experience, and he's up to his ears with Hillside
      Station since that expansion order came in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never did get the reason for that. After we complained about the
      slavery implications and got the Boss-man's okay to hold the line, why do
      we need more Lani?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you know? His sister's finally decided to try marriage. Found
      herself some overmuscled Halsite who looked good to her&mdash;but she
      couldn't crack his moral barrier." Blalok grinned. "I thought you'd be the
      first to know. Wasn't she interested in you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "You could call it that. Interested&mdash;like the way a
      dog's interested in a beefsteak. It's a good thing we had that fluke
      problem or I'd have been chewed up and digested long ago. That woman
      frightens me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could be scared by uglier things," Blalok said. "With the Boss-man's
      sister on my side I wouldn't worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think she'd be on my side? She's a cannibal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know her better than I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did&mdash;he certainly did. That first month had been one of the worst
      he had ever spent, Kennon reflected. Between Eloise and the flukes, he had
      nearly collapsed&mdash;and when it had come to the final showdown, he
      thought for a while that he'd be looking for another job. But Alexander
      had been more than passably understanding and had refused his sister's
      passionate pleas for a Betan scalp. He owed a debt of gratitude to the
      Boss-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're lucky you never knew her," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That all depends on what you mean," Blalok said as he grinned and walked
      to the door. The parting shot missed its mark entirely as Kennon looked at
      him with blank incomprehension. "You should have been a Mystic," Blalok
      said. "A knowledge of the sacred books would do you no end of good." And
      with that cryptic remark the superintendent vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That had all the elements of a snide remark," Kennon murmured to himself,
      "but my education's been neglected somewhere along the line. I don't get
      it." He shrugged and buzzed for Copper. The veterinary report would have
      to be added to the pile already before him, and the Boss-man liked to have
      his reports on time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper watched Kennon as he dictated the covering letter, her slim fingers
      dancing over the stenotype. He had been here a full year&mdash;but instead
      of becoming a familiar object, he had grown so gigantic that he filled her
      world. And it wasn't merely because he was young and beautiful. He was
      kind, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she couldn't approach him, and she wanted to so desperately that it
      was a physical pain. Other Lani had told her about men and what they could
      do. Even her old preceptress at Hillside Station had given her some advice
      when Man Allworth had tattooed the tiny V on her thigh that meant she had
      been selected for the veterinary staff. And when Old Doc had brought her
      from the Training Station to the hospital and removed her tail, she was
      certain that she was one of the lucky ones who would know love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But love wasn't a pain in the chest, an ache in the belly and thighs, an
      unfulfilled longing that destroyed sleep and made food tasteless. Love was
      supposed to be pleasant and exciting. She could remember every word her
      preceptress had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My little one," the old Lani had said, "you now wear the doctor's mark.
      And soon no one will be able to tell you from a human. You will look like
      our masters. You will share in their work. And there may be times when you
      will find favor in their eyes. Then you may learn of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love," the old voice was soft in Copper's ears. "The word is almost a
      stranger to us now, known only to the few who serve our masters. It was
      not always so. The Old Ones knew love before Man Alexander came. And our
      young were the fruit of love rather than the product of our masters'
      cunning. But you may know the flower even though you cannot bear its
      fruit. You may enter that world of pleasure-pain the Old Ones knew, that
      world which is now denied us.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember always that you are a Lani. A man may be kind to you. He may
      treat you gently. He may show you love. Yet you never will be his equal.
      Nor must you become too attached to him, for you are not human. You are
      not his natural mate. You cannot bear his young. You cannot completely
      share. You can only accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So if love should come to you, take it and enjoy it, but do not try to
      possess it. For there lies heartache rather than happiness. And it is a
      world of heartache, my little one, to long for something which you cannot
      have."
    </p>
    <p>
      To long for something which one cannot have! Copper knew that feeling. It
      had been with her ever since Kennon had come into her life that night a
      year ago. And it had grown until it had become gigantic. He was kind&mdash;yes.
      He was harsh&mdash;occasionally. Yet he had shown her no more affection
      than he would have shown a dog. Less&mdash;for he would have petted a dog
      and he did not touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, but she was not a part of his laughter. He needed her, but the
      need was that of a builder for a tool. He liked her and sometimes shared
      his problems and triumphs with her, and sometimes his defeats, but he did
      not love. There had never been for her the bright fierce look he had bent
      upon the Woman Eloise those times when she had come to him, the look men
      gave to those who found favor in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he looked at her but once with that expression she would have come to
      him though fire barred the way. The Woman Eloise was a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper looked at him across the corner of the desk, the yellow hair, the
      bronze skin, firm chin, soft lips and long straight nose, the narrowed
      eyes, hooded beneath thick brows, scanning the papers in his lean-tendoned
      hands. His nearness was an ache in her body&mdash;yet he was far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of how his hands would feel upon her. He had touched her once,
      and that touch had burned like hot iron. For hours she had felt it. He
      looked up. Her heart choked her with its beating. She would die for him if
      he would but once run his fingers over her tingling skin, and stroke her
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The naked emotion in Copper's face was readable enough, Kennon thought.
      One didn't need Sorovkin techniques to interpret what was in her mind. And
      it would have been amusing if it weren't so sad. For what she wanted, he
      couldn't give. Yet if she were human it would be easy. A hundred
      generations of Betan moral code said "never," yet when he looked at her
      their voices faded. He was a man&mdash;a member of the ruling race. She
      was an animal&mdash;a beast&mdash;a humanoid&mdash;near human but not near
      enough. To like her was easy&mdash;but to love her was impossible. It
      would be bestiality. Yet his body, less discerning than his mind,
      responded to her nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. It was a pleasant unpleasantness, a mixed emotion he could not
      analyze. In a way it was poetry&mdash;the fierce, vaguely disquieting
      poetry of the sensual Santosian bards&mdash;the lyrics that sung of the
      joys of flesh. He had never really liked them, yet they filled him with a
      vague longing, an odd uneasiness&mdash;just the sort that filled him now.
      There was a deadly parallel here. He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir? Do you want something?" Copper asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could use a cup of coffee," he said. "These reports are getting me
      down." The banality amused him&mdash;sitting here thinking of Copper and
      talking about coffee. Banality was at once the curse and the saving grace
      of mankind. It kept men from the emotional peaks and valleys that could
      destroy them. He chuckled shakily. The only alternative would be to get
      rid of her&mdash;and he couldn't (or wouldn't?&mdash;the question intruded
      slyly) do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper returned with a steaming cup which she set before him. Truly, this
      coffee was a man's drink. She had tried it once but the hot bitterness
      scalded her mouth and flooded her body with its heat. And she had felt so
      lightheaded. Not like herself at all. It wasn't a drink for Lani. Of that
      she was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he enjoyed it. He looked at her and smiled. He was pleased with her.
      Perhaps&mdash;yet&mdash;she might find favor in his eyes. The hope was
      always there within her&mdash;a hope that was at once fear and prayer. And
      if she did&mdash;she would know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked up. Copper's face was convulsed with a bright mixture of
      hope and pain. Never, he swore, had he saw anything more beautiful or sad.
      Involuntarily he placed his hand upon her arm. She flinched, her muscles
      tensing under his finger tips. It was though his fingers carried a
      galvanic current that backlashed up his arm even as it stiffened hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, Copper?" he asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, Doctor. I'm just upset."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There it was again, the calm friendly curiosity that was worse than a bath
      in ice water. Her heart sank. She shivered. She would never find her
      desire here. He was cold&mdash;cold&mdash;cold! He wouldn't see. He didn't
      care. All right&mdash;so that was how it had to be. But first she would
      tell him. Then he could do with her as he wished. "I hoped&mdash;for the
      past year that you would see me. That you would think of me not as a Lani,
      but as a beloved." The words came faster now, tumbling over one another.
      "That you would desire me and take me to those worlds we cannot know
      unless you humans show us. I have hoped so much, but I suppose it's wrong&mdash;for
      you&mdash;you are so very human, and I&mdash;well, I'm not!" The last
      three words held all the sadness and the longing of mankind aspiring to be
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear&mdash;my poor child," Kennon murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, but her eyes could not focus on his face, for his hands
      were on her shoulders and the nearness of him drove the breath from her
      body. From a distance she heard a hard tight voice that was her own. "Oh,
      sir&mdash;oh please, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands withdrew, leaving emptiness&mdash;but her heartbeat slowed and
      the pink haze cleared and she could see his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a surge of terror and triumph she realized what she saw! That
      hard bright look that encompassed and possessed her! The curved lips drawn
      over white, white teeth! The flared nostrils! The hungry demand upon his
      face that answered the demand in her heart! And she knew&mdash;at last&mdash;with
      a knowledge that turned her limbs to water, that she had found favor in
      his eyes!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mixed emotion! Ha! The author of that cliche didn't even know its meaning!
      Kennon strode furiously down the dusty road toward Station One trying to
      sublimate his inner conflict into action. It was useless, of course, for
      once he stopped moving the grim tug-of-war between training and desire
      would begin again, and no matter how it ended the result would be
      unsatisfactory. As long as he had been able to delude himself that he was
      fond of Copper the way a man is fond of some lesser species, it had been
      all right. But he knew now that he was fond of her as a man is of a woman&mdash;and
      it was hell! For no rationalization in the universe would allow him to
      define her as human. Copper was humanoid&mdash;something like human. And
      to live with her and love her would not be miscegenation, which was bad
      enough, but bestiality which was a thousand times worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although throughout most of the Brotherhood miscegenation was an unknown
      word, and even bestiality had become a loose definition on many worlds
      with humanoid populations, the words had definite meaning and moral force
      to a Betan. And&mdash;God help him&mdash;he was a Betan. A lifetime of
      training in a moral code that frowned upon mixed marriages and shrank
      appalled from even the thought of mixing species was nothing to bring face
      to face with the fact that he loved Copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was odd, Kennon reflected bitterly, that humans could do with animals
      what their customs and codes prohibited them from doing to themselves. For
      thousands of years&mdash;back to the very dawn of history when men had
      bred horses and asses to produce mules&mdash;men had been mixing species
      to produce useful hybrids. Yet a Betan who could hybridize plants or
      animals with complete equanimity shrank with horror from the thought of
      applying the same technique to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was there about a human being that was so sacrosanct? He shook his
      head angrily. He didn't know. There was no answer. But the idea&mdash;the
      belief&mdash;was there, ingrained into his attitudes, a part of his
      outlook, built carefully block by block from infancy until it now towered
      into a mighty wall that barred him from doing what he wished to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be an easier hurdle if he had been born anywhere except on Beta.
      In the rest of the Brotherhood, the color of a man's skin, the shape of
      his face, the quality and color of his hair and eyes made no difference.
      All men were brothers. But on Beta, where a variant-G sun had already
      caused genetic divergence, the brotherhood of man was a term that was
      merely given lip service. Betans were different and from birth they were
      taught to accept the difference and to live with it. Mixing of Betan stock
      with other human species, while not actually forbidden, was so encircled
      with conditioning that it was a rare Betan indeed who would risk
      self-opprobrium and the contempt of his fellows to mate with an outsider.
      And as for humanoids&mdash;Kennon shuddered. He couldn't break the
      attitudes of a lifetime. Yet he loved Copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she knew he did!
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was an even greater horror. He had fled from the office, from the
      glad light in her eyes, as a burned child flees fire. He needed time to
      think, time to plan. Yet his body and his surface thoughts wanted no plans
      or time. Living with a Lani wasn't frowned upon on Flora. Many of the
      staff did, nor did anyone seem to think less of them for doing so. Even
      Alexander himself had half-confessed to a more than platonic affection for
      a Lani called Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this was no excuse, nor would it silence the cold still voice in his
      mind that kept repeating sodomite&mdash;sodomite&mdash;sodomite with a
      passionless inflection that was even more terrible than anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five kilometers to Station One disappeared unnoticed beneath his feet
      as he walked, and he looked up in surprise to see the white walls and red
      roofs of the station looming before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Lord! Doc! What's got into you?" the stationmaster said. "You look
      like you'd seen a ghost. And out in this sun without a helmet! Come
      inside, man, before you get sunstroke!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled without humor. "Getting sunstroke is the least of my
      worries, Al," he said, but he allowed Al Crothers to usher him inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's odd that you showed up right now," Al said, his dark face showing
      the curiosity that filled him. "I just had a call from Message Center not
      five minutes ago, telling me to have you call in if you showed up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sighed. "On this island you can't get away from the phone," he said
      wryly. "O.K., where is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look pretty bushed, Doc. Maybe you'd better rest awhile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And maybe it's an emergency," Kennon interrupted. "And probably it is
      because the staff can handle routine matters&mdash;so maybe you'd better
      show me where you keep the phone."
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment please," the Message Center operator said. There were a few
      clicks in the background. "Here's your party," she continued. "Go ahead,
      Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kennon?" a nervous voice crackled from the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're needed out on Otpen One."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is calling&mdash;and what's the rush?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Douglas&mdash;Douglas Alexander. The Lani are dying! It's an emergency!
      Cousin Alex'll skin us alive if we let these Lani die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas! Kennon hadn't thought of him since the one time they had met in
      Alexandria. That was a year ago. It seemed much longer. Since the Boss-man
      had exiled his cousin to that bleak rock to the east of Flora there had
      been no word of him. And now&mdash;he laughed a sharp bark of humorless
      annoyance&mdash;Douglas couldn't have timed it better if he had tried!
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," Kennon said. "I'll come. What seems to be the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's obvious," Kennon snapped. "Otherwise you wouldn't be calling.
      Can't you tell me any more than that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're vomiting. They have diarrhea. Several have had fits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," Kennon said. "I'll be right out. Expect me in an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're leaving?" Al asked as he cradled the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a practitioner's life," Kennon said. "Full of interruptions. Can I
      borrow your jeep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll drive you. Where do you want to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the hospital," Kennon said. "I'll have to pick up my gear. It's an
      emergency all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a tough one," Al said admiringly. "I'd hate to walk five kilos in
      this heat without a hat&mdash;and then go out on a call."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. "It's not necessarily toughness. I believe in doing one
      job at a time&mdash;and my contract reads veterinary service, not personal
      problems. The job comes first and there's work to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper wasn't in sight when Kennon came back to the hospital&mdash;a fact
      for which he was grateful. He packed quickly, threw his bags into the
      jeep, and took off with almost guilty haste. He'd contact the Hospital
      from the Otpens. Right now all he wanted was to put distance between
      himself and Copper. Absence might make the heart grow fonder, but at the
      moment propinquity was by far the more dangerous thing. He pointed the
      blunt nose of the jeep toward Mount Olympus, set the autopilot, opened the
      throttle, and relaxed as best he could as the little vehicle sped at top
      speed for the outer islands. A vague curiosity filled him. He'd never been
      on the Otpens. He wondered what they were like.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Otpen One was a rocky tree-clad islet crowned with the stellate mass of a
      Class II Fortalice. But this one wasn't like Alexandria. It was fully
      manned and in service condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Airboat!" a voice crackled from the dashboard speaker of the jeep,
      "Identify yourself! You are being tracked."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon quickly flipped the IFF switch. "Dr. Kennon, from Flora," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. You are expected and are clear to land. Bring your
      vehicle down in the marked area." A section of the roof turned a garish
      yellow as Kennon circled the building. He brought the jeep in lightly,
      setting it carefully in the center of the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave your vehicle," the speaker chattered. "If you are armed leave your
      weapon behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not my habit to carry a gun," Kennon snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, sir&mdash;regulations," the speaker said. '"This is S.O.P."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon left the jeep and instantly felt the probing tingle of a search
      beam. He looked around curiously at the flat roof of the fortress with its
      domed turrets and ugly snouts of the main battery projectors pointing
      skyward. Beside him, the long metal doors of a missile launcher made a
      rectangular trace on the smooth surface of the roof. Behind him the
      central tower poked its gaunt ferromorph and durilium outline into the
      darkening sky bearing its crown of spiderweb radar antennae turning
      steadily on their gimbals covering a vast hemisphere from horizon to
      zenith with endless inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the base of the tower a man emerged. He was tall, taller even than
      Kennon, and the muscles of his body showed through the tightness of his
      battle dress. His face was harsh, and in his hands he carried a Burkholtz
      magnum&mdash;the most powerful portable weapon mankind had yet devised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are Dr. Kennon?" the trooper asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your I.D., please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon handed it over and the big man scanned the card with practiced
      eyes. "Check," he said. "Follow me, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bags," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll be taken care of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged and followed the man into the tower. A modern grav-shaft
      lowered them to the ground floor. They passed through a gloomy caricature
      of the Great Hall in Alexandria, through an iris, and down a long corridor
      lined with doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back!" the trooper said. "Against the wall! Quick! Into the doorway!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another practice alert." The trooper's voice was bored. "It gets so that
      you'd almost wish for a fight to relieve the monotony."
    </p>
    <p>
      A trooper and several Lani came down the corridor, running in disciplined
      formation. Steel clanged on steel as they turned the corner and moments
      later the whine of servos came faintly to their ears. From somewhere deep
      in the pile a rising crescendo of generators under full battle load sent
      out vibrations that could be sensed rather than heard. A klaxon squawked
      briefly. There was another clash of metal, and a harsh voice boomed
      through the corridors. "Fourteen seconds. Well done. Secure stations!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The trooper grinned. "That ties the record," he said. "We can go now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The corridor ended abruptly at an iris flanked by two sentries. They
      conferred briefly with Kennon's guide, dilated the iris, and motioned for
      Kennon to enter. The pastel interior of the modern office was a shocking
      contrast to the gray ferromorph corridors outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas Alexander was standing behind the desk. He was much the same. His
      pudgy face was haggard with uncertainty and his eyes darted back and forth
      as his fingers caressed the knobby grip of a small Burkholtz jutting from
      a holster at his waist. There were new, unpleasant furrows between his
      eyes. He looked older and the indefinable air of cruelty was more
      pronounced. He had been frightened the last time Kennon had seen him, and
      he was frightened now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure whether I am glad to see you, Kennon," he said uncertainly.
      "But I suppose I have to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon believed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have you been?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not too bad until this afternoon. Things have been going pretty well." He
      shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another. "I suppose Cousin Alex
      will skin me for this, but there's nothing else I can do." He licked his
      lips. "You've been here long enough&mdash;and you'll have to know
      eventually." He fidgeted and finally sat down behind the desk. "We have
      trouble. Half the Lani were stricken about four hours ago. It was sudden.
      No warning at all. And if they die&mdash;" his voice trailed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;what are we waiting for? Get someone to bring my bags down
      here and we'll look them over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you have to?&mdash;Can't you prescribe something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? I haven't examined the patients."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you what's wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon smiled. "I hardly think that's the way to do it. Even though your
      description might be accurate, you still might miss something of critical
      importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas sighed. "I thought that's what you'd say," he said. "Oh&mdash;very
      well&mdash;you might as well see what we have out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't possibly believe that I don't already know," Kennon said. "You
      have male Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas looked at him, his face blank with surprise. "But&mdash;how did
      you know? No one on the main island does except the Family. And we never
      talk about it. Did Eloise tell you? I noticed she was struck with you the
      day you came, and the Lani who have come out here since have been talking
      about you two. Did she do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. "She never said a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not stupid," Kennon said. "That story you've spread about artificial
      fertilization has more holes in it than a sieve. That technique has been
      investigated a thousand times. And it has never worked past the first
      generation. If you had been using it, the Lani would long ago have been
      extinct. Haploids don't reproduce, and the only way the diploid number of
      chromosomes can be kept is to replace those lost by maturation division of
      the ovum. You might be able to keep the diploid number by using immature
      ova, but the fertilization technique would be far more complex than the
      simple uterine injections you use at Hillside Station."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas looked at him blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," Kennon added, "I have a microscope. I checked your so-called
      fertilizing solution. I found spermatozoa, and spermatozoa only come from
      males. What's more, the males have to be the same species as the females
      or fertilization will not take place. So there must be male Lani. Nothing
      else fits. You've been using artificial insemination on the main-island
      Lani. And from the way this place is guarded, it's obvious that here is
      your stud farm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas shrugged and spread his hands in a gesture of resignation. "I
      suppose," he said, "that's the way Old Doc found out too. We never told
      him, but he knew before he ever came out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only thing that puzzles me," Kennon went on, "is how you managed to
      eliminate the Y-chromosome carriers within the sperm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The male sex-determinant. Half the sperm carry it, but so far as I know,
      there's never been a male born on the main island."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;that. It's something that's done in the labs here. Probably one
      of the technicians could tell you. It's called electro&mdash;electro
      freezing or something like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Electrodiaphoresis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas nodded. "That sounds like it. I don't know anything about it. One
      of Grandfather's men did the basic work. We just follow instructions." He
      shrugged. "Well&mdash;since you know the secret there's no sense in hiding
      the bodies. Come along and tell me what's wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a peculiar feeling to walk down the row of cubical rooms with their
      barred doors. The whole area reminded him of a historical novel, of the
      prisons of early human history where men confined other men for
      infractions of social customs. The grimness of the place was appalling.
      The male Lani&mdash;impressive in their physical development&mdash;were in
      miserable condition, nauseated, green-faced, retching. The sickening odors
      of vomit and diarrhea hung heavily on the air. Douglas coughed and held a
      square of cloth to his face, and even Kennon, strong-stomached as he was,
      could feel his viscera twitch in sympathy with the caged sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Fleming, man!" Kennon exploded. "You can't keep them here. Get them
      out! Give them some fresh air! This place would make a well man sick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas looked at him, "I wouldn't take one of them out unless I had him
      shackled and there was an armed guard to help me. Those males are the most
      vicious, cunning, and dangerous animals on Kardon. They exist with but one
      thought in mind&mdash;to kill!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked curiously through a barred door at one of the Lani. He lay
      on a bare cot, a magnificently muscled figure with a ragged black beard
      hiding his face. There were dozens of scars on his body and one angry
      purple area on his thick right forearm where flesh had been torn away not
      too long ago. Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead and soft moaning
      noises came from his tight lips as he pressed his abdomen with
      thick-fingered hands. "He doesn't look so dangerous," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch it!" Douglas warned. "Don't get too close!" But the warning was too
      late. Kennon touched the bars, and as he did, the Lani moved with fluid
      speed, one huge hand clutching Kennon's sleeve and pulling him against the
      bars while the other darted for his throat. Fingers bit into Kennon's neck
      and tightened in a viselike grip. Kennon reacted automatically. His arms
      came up inside the Lani's and crashed down, elbows out, tearing the Lani
      loose. He jumped back, rubbing his bruised throat. "That fellow's not
      sick!" he gasped. "He's crazy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lani glared at him through the bars, disappointment written on his
      scarred and bearded face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warned you," Douglas said. His voice held an undertone of malicious
      laughter. "He must be sick or he would have killed you. George is clever
      in a stupid sort of way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked into the cubicle. The Lani glared back and growled. There
      was a beastlike note in his voice that made the short hairs on Kennon's
      neck prickle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That fellow needs a lesson," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to give it to him?" Douglas asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not particularly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!&mdash;man!&mdash;you afraid!" the Lani taunted. His voice was thick
      and harsh. "All men fear me. All Lani, too. I am boss. Come close again
      man and I kill you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they all that stupid?" Kennon asked. "He sounds like a homicidal
      moron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not stupid," Douglas said. "Just uneducated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is he so murderous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's his training. All his life he has fought. From childhood his life
      has been based on his ability to survive in an environment where every
      male is his enemy. You see here the sublimation of individuality. He
      cannot co-operate with another male. He hates them, and they in turn hate
      him. George, here, is a perfect example of absolute freedom from
      restraint." Douglas smiled unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His whole history is one of complete lack of control. As an infant, being
      a male, his mother thought she was favored by the gods and she denied him
      nothing. In fact we were quite insistent that she gave him everything he
      wanted. By the time he was able to walk and take care of himself, he was
      completely spoiled, selfish, and authoritative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we took him and a dozen others exactly like him and put them
      together." Douglas grinned. "You should see what happens when a dozen
      spoiled brats are forced to live together. It's more fun. The little
      beasts hate each other on sight. And we stimulate them to compete for
      toys, food, and drink. Never quite enough to go around. You can imagine
      what happens. Instead of sharing, each little selfish individualist fights
      to get everything he can grab. Except for one thing we don't punish them
      no matter what they do. If anyone shows signs of co-operating he is
      disciplined severely, the first time. The next time, he is culled. But
      other than that, we leave them alone. They develop their personalities and
      their muscles&mdash;and if one proves to be too much for his fellows we
      transfer him to a more advanced class where the competition is keener, and
      he learns what it is to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At puberty we add sex drive to the basics, and by the time our male
      reaches maturity we have something like George. Actually, George is more
      mature than either you or I. He has all the answers he needs. He's strong,
      solitary, authoritative, and selfish. He has no curiosity and resents
      encroachment. He's a complete individualist. If he proves out he should
      make an excellent sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't he dangerous to handle?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but we take precautions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon grimaced with distaste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at it objectively," Douglas said. "We're trying to select the best
      physical type we can in the hope that he'll pass his qualities to his
      offspring, and there's no better practical way to select the strongest and
      hardiest than by natural selection. We control their environment as little
      as possible and let Nature do our educating until they're old enough to be
      useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally, there are some things which we cannot provide, such as
      exposure to disease, to the elements, and to predators. The one isn't
      selective about whom it infects, while the others would tend to produce
      co-operation as a matter of survival."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't there a great deal of mortality under such a regimen?" Kennon
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as much as you might expect. It's about twenty per cent. And there is
      a great deal of compensation from a management viewpoint. We get
      essentially the same physical end product as we would from a closely
      managed operation, plus a great saving in labor. Males, you see, are
      fairly expendable. We only need a few a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's brutal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is, but life is brutal. Still, it's efficient for our purposes. We
      merely take advantage of natural impulses to produce a better product.
      Grandfather got the idea out of an old book&mdash;something about the
      noble savage, natural selection and survival of the fittest. He thought it
      was great&mdash;said there was nothing like relentless competition to
      bring out the strongest and hardiest types. And he's been right for
      centuries. Can you imagine anything much better than George&mdash;from a
      physical viewpoint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a magnificent animal," Kennon admitted as he eyed the Lani. "But it
      seems to me that you could train some obedience into him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas shook his head. "That would introduce a modifying factor,
      something bigger and more powerful than the male himself. And that would
      modify the results. We can control them well enough with knockout gas and
      shackles. And those things, oddly enough, don't destroy their pride or
      self-esteem. They think that we use them because we are afraid, and it
      satisfies their egos."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon eyed the caged Lani dubiously. "This is going to be difficult. I
      must examine them and treat them, but if they're all as homicidal as this
      one&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You fight me man," George interrupted, his face twisted into lines of
      transparent guile. "I am boss and others do as I say. You beat me, then
      you are boss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this true?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's true enough," Douglas said. "George is the leader and if you
      beat him you'd be top male until some other one got courage enough to
      challenge you. But he's just trying to get his hands on you. He'd like to
      kill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked at the big humanoid appraisingly. George was huge, at least
      five centimeters taller and fifteen kilograms heavier than himself. And he
      was all muscle. "I don't think I'd care to accept that challenge unless I
      was forced to," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas chuckled. "I don't blame you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sighed. "It looks like we are going to need reinforcements to get
      these brutes under control. I'm not going in there with them, and I can't
      examine them from out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we can hold them all right. Paralysis gas and shackles will keep them
      quiet. There's no need to bother the troopers. We can handle this by
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. "It's your baby. You should know what you're doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," Douglas said confidently. "Wait here until I get the gas capsules
      and the equipment." He turned and walked back to the entrance to the cell
      block. At the iris he turned. "Be careful," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry, I will." Kennon looked at George through the bars and the
      humanoid glared back, his eyes bright with hatred. Kennon felt the short
      hairs prickle along the back of his neck. George roused a primal emotion&mdash;an
      elemental dislike that was deeper than reason&mdash;an antagonism
      intensely physical, almost overpowering&mdash;a purely adrenal response
      that had no business in the make-up of a civilized human.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thought the Lani had a number of human traits until he had
      encountered George. But if George was a typical male&mdash;then the Lani
      were alien. He flexed his muscles and stared coldly into the burning blue
      eyes behind the bars. There would be considerable satisfaction in beating
      this monstrosity to a quivering pulp. Millennia of human pre-eminence&mdash;of
      belief that nothing, no matter how big or muscular, should fail to
      recognize that a man's person was inviolate&mdash;fed the fuel of his
      anger. The most ferocious beasts on ten thousand worlds had learned this
      lesson. And yet this animal had laid hands on him with intent to kill. A
      cold corner of his mind kept telling him that he wasn't behaving
      rationally, but he disregarded it. George was a walking need for a lesson
      in manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get the idea that I'm afraid of you&mdash;you overmuscled oaf,"
      Kennon snapped. "I can handle you or anyone like you. And if you put your
      hands on me again I'll beat you within an inch of your worthless life."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lani snarled. "Let me out and I kill you. But you are like all men.
      You use gun and iron&mdash;not fair fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas returned with a gas capsule and a set of shackles. "All right," he
      said. "We're ready for him." He handed Kennon the shackles and a key to
      the cell door&mdash;and drew his Burkholtz.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See," the Lani growled. "It is as I say. Men are cowards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know gun?" Douglas asked as he pointed the muzzle of the Burkholtz at
      the Lani.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," George growled. "Gun kill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does indeed," Douglas said. "Now get back&mdash;clear back against the
      wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      George snarled but didn't move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll count three," Douglas said, "and if you're not back by then I'll
      burn you down. You'll obey even if you won't do anything else.&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      George retreated to the far end of his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now face the wall." Douglas tossed the gas capsule into the cell. The
      thin-walled container broke, releasing a cloud of vapor. George crumpled
      to the floor. "Now we wait a couple of minutes for the gas to dissipate,"
      Douglas said. "After that he's all yours. You can go in and put the irons
      on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will he be out long?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About five minutes. After that he'll have muscular control." Douglas
      chuckled. "They're stupid," he said. "They know what gas does to them, but
      they never have sense enough to hold their breath. They could be twice as
      much trouble as they are. All right, it's safe to go in now." Douglas let
      the gun dangle in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon unlocked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And George rolled over, muscles bunched and driving! He hit the door with
      such force that Kennon was slammed against the wall, dazed&mdash;half
      stunned by the speed of the attack. George&mdash;he had time to think in
      one brief flash&mdash;wasn't stupid. He had held his breath for the
      necessary two minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas jerked the blaster up and fired, but his target was too quick.
      George dropped and rolled. The sizzling streak of violet flashed inches
      above his body and tore a six-inch hole through the back of the cell. And
      then George was on him! The huge, marvelously fast hands of the humanoid
      wrenched the blaster out of Douglas's hands and jerked him forward. A
      scream burst from Douglas as George's hands closed around his neck.
      Muscles sprang into writhing life in the humanoid's huge forearms. There
      was a soft, brittle crack, and Douglas sagged limp in the iron grip that
      held him dangling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faugh!" George grunted. He dropped Douglas as Kennon pushed the door back
      and came out into the passageway. "Maybe you make better fight," George
      said as he lowered his head into the muscular mass of his broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon eyed him appraisingly, swinging the irons in his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the Lani didn't charge. He moved slowly, half crouched, long
      arms held slightly forward. Kennon backed away, watching the humanoid's
      eyes for that telltale flicker of the pupils that gives warning of attack.
      The expression on George's face never changed. It was satisfied&mdash;smug
      almost&mdash;reflecting the feelings of a brute conditioned to kill and
      given an opportunity to do so. The Lani radiated confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shivered involuntarily. He wasn't frightened, but he had never met
      an opponent like this. A chill raced up the back of his legs and spread
      over his stomach and chest. His mouth was dry and his muscles quivered
      with tense anticipation. But his concentration never wavered. His hard
      blue eyes never left George's, searching with microscopic intentness for
      the faintest sign of the Lani's intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      George charged&mdash;hands reaching for Kennon's throat, face twisted in a
      snarl of rage and hate. But even as he charged Kennon moved. He ducked
      beneath the Lani's outstretched hands and drove his left fist deep into
      George's belly just below the breastbone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Air whistled out of the Lani's gaping mouth as he bent double from the
      power of the blow. Kennon clipped him on the chin with a driving knee,
      snapping George's head back and smashed the bearded face with the
      shackles. Blood spurted and George screamed with rage. One of the Lani's
      big hands wrapped around the shackles and tugged. Kennon let go and drove
      another left to George's ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lani threw the irons at Kennon, but his aim was poor. One of the
      handcuff rings scraped across Kennon's cheek, but did nothing more than
      break the skin. Half paralyzed by the blows to his solar plexus, George's
      co-ordination was badly impaired. But he kept trying. Kennon wrapped lean
      fingers about one of George's outstretched hands, bent, pivoted, and
      slammed the Lani with bone-crushing force against the bars of a nearby
      cell. But George didn't go down. "He's more brute than man," Kennon
      thought. "No man could take a beating like that!" He moved aside from
      George's stumbling rush, feeling a twinge of pity for the battered
      humanoid. It was no contest. Strong as he was, George didn't know the
      rudiments of hand-to-hand fighting. His reactions were those of an animal,
      to close, clutch, bite, and tear. Even if he were completely well, the
      results would have been the same. It would merely have taken longer.
      Kennon drove a vicious judo chop to the junction of the Lani's neck and
      shoulder. Brute strength was no match for the highly evolved mayhem that
      every spaceman learns as a necessary part of his trade. George had never
      been on planet leave in a spaceport town. He knew nothing about the dives,
      the crimps, the hostile port police. His idea of fighting was that of a
      beast, but Kennon was a civilized man to whom fighting was an art
      perfected by millennia of warfare. And Kennon knew his trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so it took longer than Kennon expected because George was big, George
      was strong, and George had courage and pride that kept him coming as long
      as the blazing will behind his blazing eyes could drive his battered body.
      But the end was inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked at his bloody arm where George's teeth had reached their
      mark. It was hardly more than a scratch, but it had been close. George had
      his lesson and Kennon felt oddly degraded. He sighed, dragged George back
      into the cell, and locked the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Douglas. The howls of hate from the caged Lani died to a
      sullen silence as Kennon gently examined the limp body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas wasn't dead. His neck was dislocated, not broken, but he was in
      serious condition. Kennon was still bending over Douglas wondering how to
      call for help when three guards burst through the door, faces grim,
      weapons at the ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's going on here?" the leader demanded. "The board showed an open
      door down here." He saw the body&mdash;"Mr. Douglas!" he gasped. "The
      commandant will have to know about this!" He took a communicator from his
      waist belt and spoke rapidly into it. "Arleson in stud cell block," he
      said. "Attempted escape. One casualty&mdash;Douglas Alexander&mdash;yes,
      that's right. No&mdash;he's not dead. Send a litter and bearers. Inform
      the commandant. I am making investigation on the spot. Out." He turned to
      look coldly at Kennon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you&mdash;and what happened here?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean you took George!" Arleson said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look in his cell if you don't believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldier looked and then turned hack to Kennon. There was awed respect
      in his hard brown eyes. "You did that!&mdash;to him! Man, you're a
      fighter," he said in an unbelieving voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stretcher detail manned by two sober-faced Lani females came in, loaded
      Douglas's body on the stretcher, and silently bore it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Douglas was a fool," Arleson said. "He knew we never handle this kind
      without maximum restraint. I wonder why he did it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't say. He told me that gas and shackles would hold him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knew better. These Lani know gas capsules. All George had to do was
      hold his breath. In that cell George would have killed you. You couldn't
      have stayed away from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. Maybe that was what Douglas had wanted. Kennon sighed. He
      didn't have the answer. And it could just be that Douglas had tried to
      show off. Well, he would pay for it. He'd have a stiff neck for months,
      and perhaps that was a proper way to end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Commander Mullins, a thin gray-faced man with the hard cold eyes of a
      professional soldier, came into the corridor followed by another trooper.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes took in the wreckage that had been George, the split lips, the
      smashed nose, the puffed eyes, the cuts and bruises, and then raked across
      Kennon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spaceman&mdash;hey?" he asked. "I've seen work like that before."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. "I was once. I'm station veterinarian now. Douglas called
      me over&mdash;said it was an emergency."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullins nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;why aren't you tending to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to examine them," Kennon said gesturing at the cells. "And I don't
      want any more trouble like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry. You won't have it. Now that you've beaten George, you'll
      have no trouble at all. You're top dog." Mullins gestured at the cages.
      "They'll be good for a while. Now you'd better get on with your work.
      There's been enough disruption of routine for today. The men will help
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon checked in at the commandant's office before he left for the main
      island.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is Douglas?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's alive," Mullins said. "We flew him to Albertsville&mdash;and good
      riddance. How are the Lani?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll be all right," Kennon said. "It's just food poisoning. I suggest
      you check your kitchen and your food handlers. There's a break in
      sanitation that could incapacitate your whole command. I found a few
      things wrong but there are probably more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll check on it&mdash;and thanks for the advice," Mullins said. "Sit
      down, Doctor. Your airboat won't be serviced for another few minutes. Tell
      me how things are on the main island. How's Blalok?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I used to be a frequent visitor there. But with that young pup
      here, I couldn't leave. I didn't dare to. He'd have disrupted routine in a
      single day. Look what he did in half an hour. Frankly, I owe you a debt
      for getting him off my hands." Mullins chuckled dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a fine thing to say," Kennon grinned. "But I can sympathize. It
      took us two months to straighten out Alexandria after the Boss-man sent
      him here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;we're under control now. Things are going pretty smoothly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They'll be better here," Mullins said. "Now that Douglas is gone." He
      shrugged. "I hope the Boss doesn't send him back. He's hard to handle and
      he makes discipline a problem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you tell me&mdash;or would it be violating security?" Kennon said.
      "Why do you have a Class II installation on full war footing out here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullins chuckled. "It's no secret," he said. "There was a commercial raid
      on this place about fifty years ago. Seems as though one of our
      competitors didn't like us. Alexandria was on a war footing then and
      managed to hold them off. But it scared the Old Man. You see, our
      competitive position is based on Lani labor. Our competitors didn't know
      that. Their intelligence wasn't so good. Up until that time, we'd been
      keeping the males out here in what was hardly more than a stockade. Those
      people could have taken a few dozen females and a couple of males and
      they'd have been in business. But they didn't know. They tried to smash
      Alexandria instead. Naturally they didn't have a chance. And after it was
      over the Old Man got smart. He still had the tapes for Alexandria so he
      built a duplicate out here and spent a few millions on modern armament.
      The way we're set now it'd take a battle group to hurt us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how about security? Don't the others know about the Lani now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a moot question. But it won't do them any good. They can't crack
      this place, and without males, all the females on Flora wouldn't do them
      enough long-term good to pay for the force they'd need to be successful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that's why the males are isolated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's another reason&mdash;two of them in fact. One is physical. Even
      the best male is a dangerous beast. They have a flair for violence that
      makes them useless as labor and their training doesn't help matters. And
      the other is mental. The females on the main island believe that we humans
      are responsible for the continuation of their breed. This tends to keep
      them in line. We have a great deal more trouble with them out here once
      they know the truth. We've had a number of cases of females trying to
      engineer a male's escape. But they're never repeated," Mullins said
      grimly. "Actually, it would be an interesting life out here, except for
      the abattoir." He grimaced. "That's an unpleasant chore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean&mdash;" Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly. What else could we do with senile animals?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's murder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullins shook his head. "No more than killing a cow for beef."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," Kennon said, "I've never thought of what happened to aged
      Lani. Sure, I've never seen one, but&mdash;Lord Lister!&mdash;I'm a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll get used to the idea," Mullins said. "They aren't human, and
      except for a few, they aren't as intelligent as a Santosian Varl. I know
      that they look like us except for those tails, but that's as far as it
      goes. I've spent two hundred years with them and I know what I'm talking
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what Alexander says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should know. He's lived with them all his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;perhaps. But I'm not convinced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither was Old Doc&mdash;not until the day he died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he change then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I wasn't there. But Old Doc was a stubborn cuss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon stood up. "I've given instructions for treatment to your corpsman,"
      he said. "Now I think I'd better be getting back. I have some reports to
      finish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mullins smiled grimly. "You know," he said, "I get the feeling that you
      don't approve of this operation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frankly, I don't," Kennon said, "but I signed a contract." He turned
      toward the door and gestured to the two Lani who waited outside with his
      bags. "I can find my way to the roof," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;good luck," Mullins said. "We'll call you again if we need
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do that," Kennon replied. He wanted to leave, to get away from this place
      and back to the main island. He wanted to see Copper. He'd be damned if
      anyone was going to butcher her. If he had to stay here until she died of
      old age, he'd do it. But nobody was going to hurt her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kennon wondered if his colleagues in human medicine felt toward their
      patients as he did toward the Lani, or if they ultimately lost their
      individuality and became mere hosts for diseases, parasites, and tumors&mdash;vehicles
      for the practice of surgical and medical skills&mdash;economic units whose
      well-being meant a certain amount of credits. Probably not, he decided.
      They were human and their very humanity made them persons rather than
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the possession of individuality was not an asset in the practice of
      animal medicine where economics was the main factor and the satisfaction
      of the owner the principal personality problem. The normal farm animals,
      the shrakes, cattle, sheep, morks, and swine were no problem. They were
      merely a job. But the Lani were different. They weren't human, but they
      were intelligent and they did have personality even though they didn't
      possess that indefinable quality that separated man from the beasts. It
      was hard to treat them with dispassionate objectivity. In fact, it was
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this lack of objectivity annoyed him. Should he be this way? Was he
      right to identify them as individuals and treat them as persons rather
      than things? The passing months had failed to rob them of their
      personalities: they had not become the faceless mass of a herd of cattle
      or a flock of sheep. They were still not essentially different from humans&mdash;and
      wouldn't men themselves lose many of their human characteristics if they
      were herded into barracks and treated as property for forty generations?
      Wouldn't men, too, approach the animal condition if they were bred and
      treated as beasts, their pedigrees recorded, their types winnowed and
      selected? The thought was annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be better, Kennon reflected, if he didn't have time to think, if
      he were so busy he could drop to his bed exhausted each night and sleep
      without dreaming, if he could keep on the run so fast that he wouldn't
      have time to sit and reflect. But he had done his work too well. He had
      trained his staff too thoroughly. They could handle the petty routines of
      minor treatment and laboratory tests as well as he. He had only the
      intellectual stimulation of atypical cases and these were all too rare.
      The routine inspections were boring, yet he forced himself to make them
      because they filled the time. The hospital wards were virtually empty of
      patients, the work was up to date, the whole island was enjoying a
      carnival of health, and Kennon was still impaled upon the horns of his
      dilemma. It wasn't so bad now that the first shock was over, but it was
      bad enough&mdash;and showed no signs of getting better. Now that Copper
      realized he wanted her, she did nothing to make his life easier. Instead
      she did her best to get underfoot, usually in some provocative position.
      It was enough to try the patience of a marble statue Kennon reflected
      grimly. But it did have its humorous side and were it not for the fact
      that Copper wasn't human could have been thoroughly enjoyable. That,
      however, was the real hell of it. He couldn't relax and enjoy the contest&mdash;his
      feet were on too slippery ground. And Copper with her unerring female
      instinct knew just what to do to make the footing slipperier. Sooner or
      later, she was certain that he would fall. It was only a question of
      applying sufficient pressure at the right spot and the right time. Now
      that she knew he desired her, she was content to wait. The only thing that
      had bothered her was the uncertainty whether he cared or not. For Copper
      the future was a simple thing and she was lighthearted about it. But not
      so Kennon. Even after the initial shock had passed there still remained
      the moral customs, the conditioning, and the prohibitions. But Copper&mdash;was
      Copper&mdash;and somehow the conditioning lost its force in her presence.
      Perhaps, he thought wryly, it was a symptom of the gradual erosion of his
      moral character in this abnormal environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm getting stale," he confided to Copper as he sat in his office idly
      turning the pages of the Kardon Journal of Allied Medical Sciences.
      "There's nothing to do that's interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could help me," Copper said as she looked up from the pile of cards
      she was sorting. He had given her the thankless task of reorganizing the
      files, and she was barely half through the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's nothing to do that's interesting," he repeated. He cocked his
      head to one side. From this angle Copper looked decidedly intriguing as
      she bent over the file drawer and replaced a stack of cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could suggest something," Copper said demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know," he said. "You're full of suggestions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking that we could go on a picnic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A picnic. Take a lunch and go somewhere in the jeep. Maybe up into the
      hills. I think it might be fun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" Kennon agreed. "At least it would break the monotony. Tell you
      what. You run up to the house and tell Kara to pack a lunch and we'll take
      the day off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! I hoped you'd say that. I'm getting tired of these dirty old
      cards." She stood up and sidled past the desk. Kennon resisted the impulse
      to slap as she went past, and congratulated himself on his self-control as
      she looked at him with a half-disappointed expression on her face. She had
      expected it, he thought gleefully. Score one for morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. Whatever the other Lani might be, Copper was different. Quick,
      volatile, intelligent, she was a constant delight, a flashing kaleidoscope
      of unexpected facets. Perhaps the others were the same if he knew them
      better. But he didn't know them&mdash;and avoided learning. In that
      direction lay ulcers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll go to Olympus," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper looked dubious. "I'd rather not go there. That's forbidden ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh nonsense. You're merely superstitious."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. "Perhaps you're right. You usually are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the virtue of being a man. Even if I'm wrong, I'm right." He
      chuckled at the peculiar expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now off with you&mdash;and get that lunch basket packed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed. "Yes, master. Your slave flies on winged feet to execute your
      commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. Copper had been reading Old Doc's romances again. He
      recognized the florid style.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon landed the jeep in a mountain meadow halfway up the slope of the
      peacefully slumbering volcano. It was quiet and cool, and the light breeze
      was blowing Olympus's smoky cap away from them to the west. Copper
      unpacked the lunch. She moved slowly. After all, there was plenty of time,
      and she wasn't very hungry. Neither was Kennon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go for a walk," Copper said. "The woods look cool&mdash;and maybe
      we can work up an appetite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good idea. I could use some exercise. That lunch looks big enough to
      choke a horse and I'd like to do it justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked through the woods, skirting scant patches of underbrush,
      slowly moving higher on the mountain slopes. The trees, unlike those of
      Beta, did not end abruptly at a snow line, but pushed green fingers upward
      through passages between old lava flows, on whose black wrinkled surfaces
      nothing grew. The faint hum of insects and the piping calls of the
      birdlike mammals added to the impression of remoteness. It was hard to
      believe that scarcely twenty kilometers from this primitive microcosm was
      the border of the highly organized and productive farmlands of Outworld
      Enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think we can see the hospital if we go high enough?" Copper said.
      She panted a little, unaccustomed to the altitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly," Kennon said. "It is a long distance away. But we should be
      able to see Alexandria," he added. "That's high enough and big enough." He
      looked at her curiously. "How is it that you're so breathless?" he asked.
      "We're not that high. You're getting fat with too much soft living."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper smiled. "Perhaps I'm getting old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," Kennon chuckled. "It's just fat. Come to think of it you are
      plumper. Not that I mind, but if you're going to keep that sylphlike
      figure you'd better go on a diet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too good to me," Copper said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're darn right I am. Well&mdash;let's get going. Exercise is always
      good for the waistline, and I'd like to see what's up ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely a kilometer ahead they came to a wall of lava that barred their
      path. "Oh, oh," Kennon said. "We can't go over that." He looked at the
      wrinkled and shattered rock with its knifelike edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think my feet could take it," Copper admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks like the end of the trail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not quite," Kennon said. "There seems to be a path here." He
      pointed to a narrow cleft in the black rock. "Let's see where it goes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper hung back. "I don't think I want to," she said doubtfully. "It
      looks awfully dark and narrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, stop it. Nothing's going to hurt us. Come on." Kennon took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwillingly Copper allowed herself to be led forward. "There's something
      about this place that frightens me," she said uncomfortably as the high
      black wails closed in, narrowing until only a slit of yellow sky was
      visible overhead. The path underfoot was surprisingly smooth and free from
      rocks, but the narrow corridor, steeped in shadows, was gloomy and
      depressingly silent. It even bothered Kennon, although he wouldn't admit
      it. What forces had sliced this razor-thin cleft in the dense rock around
      them? Earthquake probably. And if it happened once it could happen again.
      He would hate to be trapped here entombed in shattered rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the passage widened, then abruptly it ended. A bleak vista of
      volcanic ash dotted with sputter cones opened before them. It was a flat
      tableland, roughly circular, scarcely half a kilometer across, a
      desolation of black rock, stunted trees and underbrush, and gray volcanic
      ash. A crater, somewhat larger than the rest, lay with its nearest edge
      about two hundred meters away. The rock edges were fire polished, gleaming
      in the yellow sunshine, and the thin margin of trees and brush surrounding
      the depression were gnarled and shrunken, twisted into fantastic shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey! what's this?" Kennon asked curiously. "That crater looks peculiar,
      like a meteor had struck here&mdash;but those stunted plants&mdash;hmm&mdash;there
      must have been some radioactivity too." He looked at the crater
      speculatively. "Now I wonder&mdash;" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper had turned a sickly white. "No!" she said in a half-strangled voice&mdash;"oh,
      no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked at her. "You know what this is?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Copper said. But her voice was unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're lying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't know." Copper wailed. "I'm only guessing. I've never seen
      this place before in my life! Please!&mdash;let's get out of here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you know about this," Kennon demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's the Pit," Copper said. "The redes don't say where it is. But
      the description fits&mdash;the Circle of Death, the Twisted Land&mdash;it's
      all like the redes say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Redes?&mdash;what are redes? And what is this business about circles of
      death? There's something here that's peculiar and I want to know what it
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's nothing. Truly. Just let's go back. Let's leave this place. It's no
      good. It's tabu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tabu? You've never used that word before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forbidden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who forbids it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Gods&mdash;the Old Ones. It is not for Lani. Nor for you." Her voice
      was harsh. "Come away before it is too late. Before the Silent Death
      strikes you down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to have a look at this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be killed!" Copper said. "And if you die, I die too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be foolish. There's nothing here that can hurt me. See those trees
      and plants growing right up to the crater's edge. If they can take it
      permanently, I can stand it for a few moments. If there's any
      radioactivity there, it's not very much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the redes say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, forget those redes. I know what I'm doing. Besides, I'm a Betan and
      can stand more radiation than most men. A brief exposure isn't going to
      hurt me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go and I go too," Copper said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll stay here where it's safe," Kennon said flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going with you," Copper repeated. "I don't want to live without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you I won't be hurt. And one quick look isn't going to bother
      whatever's down there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what Roga the Foolish said when he opened Lyssa's tower. But he
      brought men to Flora. And your little look may bring an even greater
      calamity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged, and started Walking toward the crater's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to order her back, but the words died on his tips as he saw the
      terror and determination on her face. Neither commands nor pleas would
      move her. If he went she would follow. The only way he could stop her
      would be with violence, and he didn't want to manhandle her. He felt an
      odd mixture of pride, tenderness, and admiration for her. Were their
      situations reversed, he doubted whether he would have the courage she was
      showing. He sighed. Perhaps she was right. Perhaps he did need an
      antiradiation suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," he said. "You win. I'll get some protective clothing and look
      at it later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her knees sagged, but he caught her before she fell, and held her erect
      until her strength returned. Belatedly he understood the emotional strain
      that had been gripping her. "If you come back later, sir, you'll take me
      with you." The words were a statement, not a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. "Providing you wear a radiation suit," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grimaced with distaste and he chuckled. Clothing and Copper simply
      didn't get along together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," she said unhappily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's one more condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" she asked suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you tell me about this place. You obviously know something about it,
      and with all your talking, you've never mentioned it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is forbidden to talk of these things to men," Copper said&mdash;and
      then, perversely, "Do you want me to tell you now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;it can wait. We have come a long way and I am hungry. I listen
      poorly on an empty stomach. Let's go back to the jeep and you can tell me
      later."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper smiled. "That's good," she said. "I'd feel better away from this
      place."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I was a poor learner of the redes," Copper confessed. "And I'll have to
      skip the Mysteries. I never even tried to learn them. Somehow I was sure
      I'd never be a preceptress." She settled herself more comfortably on the
      tawny grass and watched him as he lay on his back beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" Kennon said, "Preceptress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The guardians of our traditions. They know the redes and mysteries by
      heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have kept your religion alive that way all these years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't exactly religion," Copper said. "It's more like history, we
      learn it to remember that we were once a great race&mdash;and that we may
      be again. Someday there will come a male, a leader to bring us out of
      bondage, and our race will be free of dependence on men. There will be
      pairings again, and freedom to live as we please." She looked thoughtfully
      at Kennon. "You might even be the one&mdash;even though you are human.
      You're different from the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're prejudiced." Kennon smiled. "I'm no different. Well&mdash;not very
      different at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not my thought," Copper said. "You are very different indeed. No
      man has ever resisted a Lani as long as you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. "Let's not go into that now. What are these redes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not remember them all," Copper apologized. "I was&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've said that before. Tell me what you do know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember the beginning fairly well," she said. "It goes back to the
      time before Flora when everything was nothing and the Master Himself was
      lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without warning her voice changed to a rhythmic, cadenced chant that was
      almost a song. Her face became rapt and introspective as she rocked slowly
      from side to side. The rhythm was familiar and then he recognized it&mdash;the
      unintelligible music he had often heard coming from the barracks late at
      night when no men were around&mdash;the voiceless humming that the Lani
      sang at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      First there was Darkness&mdash;starless and sunless
    </p>
    <p>
      Void without form&mdash;darker than night
    </p>
    <p>
      Then did the Master&mdash;Lord of Creation
    </p>
    <p>
      Wave His right hand, saying, "Let there be light!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Verse, Kennon thought. That was logical. People remember poetry better
      than prose. But the form was not what he'd normally expect. It was
      advanced, a style that was past primitive blank verse or heroic
      pentameter. He listened intently as Copper went on.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Light filled the heavens, bright golden glowing,
     Brought to the Void by His wondrous hand;
     Then did the Master&mdash;Lord of Creation&mdash;
     Nod His great head, saying, "Let there be land!"
     Air, land, and water formed into being,
     Born in the sight of His all-seeing eyes;
     Then did the master&mdash;Lord of Creation&mdash;
     Smile as He murmured, "Let life arise!"
     All of the life conceived by the Master,
     Varied in shape as the grasses and birds;
     Hunters and hunted, moveless and moving,
     Came into form at the sound of His words.
</pre>
    <p>
      "That's a great deal like Genesis," Kennon said with mild astonishment.
      "Where could you have picked that up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the beginning of our race," Copper said. "It came to us with Ulf and
      Lyssa&mdash;but what is Genesis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A part of an ancient religion&mdash;one that is still followed on some of
      the Central Worlds. Its followers call themselves Christians. They say it
      came from Earth, the mother-world of men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our faith has no name. We are children of Lyssa, who was a daughter of
      the Master."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an odd similarity," Kennon said. "But other races have had stories
      of the Creation. And possibly there may be another explanation. Your
      ancestors could have picked this up from Alexander's men. They came from
      Earth originally and some of them could have been Christians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Cooper said. "This rede is long before Man Alexander. It is the
      origin of our world, even before Ulf and Lyssa. It is the first Book&mdash;the
      Book of the God-spell. Man Alexander came in the sixth Book&mdash;the Book
      of Roga."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no point in arguing about it," Kennon said. "Go on&mdash;tell me
      the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's going to be a long story," Copper said. "Even though I have
      forgotten some of it, I can chant the redes for hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon braced his back against one of the fat tires of the jeep. "I'm a
      good listener," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chuckled. "You asked for this," she said&mdash;and took up the verses
      where she had left off. And Kennon learned the Lani version of creation,
      of the first man and woman, cast out of Heaven for loving each other
      despite the Master's objection, of how they came to Flora and founded the
      race of the Lani. He learned how the Lani grew in numbers and power, how
      they split into two warring groups over the theological point of whether
      Ulf or Lyssa was the principal deity, how Roga the Foolish opened Lyssa's
      tower to find out whether the Ulfians or Lyssans were right, and brought
      the Black Years to Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the trial of Roga and the details of his torture by the priests
      of Ulf and the priests of Lyssa&mdash;united by this greatest sacrilege.
      And he heard the Lani version of the landing of Alexander's ship and man's
      conquest of Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a story of savagery and superstition, of blood and intolerance, of
      bravery and cowardice, of love and beauty. Yet through it all, even
      through the redes that described the Conquest, there was a curious
      remoteness, a lack of emotion that made the verses more terrible as they
      flowed in passionless rhythm from Copper's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough!" Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you you wouldn't like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's horrible. How can you remember such things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We begin to learn them as soon as we can talk. We know the redes almost
      our entire lives." Copper was silent for a moment. "There's lots more,"
      she said, "but it's all about our lives since the Man Alexander&mdash;the
      old one&mdash;took possession of us. And most of the newer redes are
      pretty dull. Our life hasn't changed much since the men came. The Book of
      Man is boring." Copper sighed. "I have dared a great deal by telling you
      these things. If the others knew, they would kill both of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why tell me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you," she said simply. "You wanted to know&mdash;and I can deny
      you nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of tenderness swept over him. She would give her life for him&mdash;and
      what would he give? Nothing. Not even his prejudices. His face twisted. If
      she was only human, If she wasn't just an animal. If he wasn't a Betan.
      If, if, if. Resentment gorged his throat. It was unfair&mdash;so damned
      unfair. He had no business coming here. He should have stayed on Beta or
      at least on a human world where he would never have met Copper. He loved
      her, but he couldn't have her. It was Tantalus and Sisyphus rolled into
      one unsightly package and fastened to his soul. With a muttered curse he
      rose to his feet, and as he did he stopped&mdash;frozen&mdash;staring at
      Copper as though he had never seen her before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you say that Roga was judged responsible for Alexander coming
      here?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He went into Lyssa's tower&mdash;where Ulf and Lyssa tried to call Heaven&mdash;and
      with his foolish meddling set the tower alight with a glow that all could
      see. Less than a week later the Man Alexander came."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was this tower?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where Alexandria now stands. Man Alexander destroyed it and built his
      house upon its ruins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was that place of the Pit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Shrine of Ulf&mdash;where the God-Egg struck Flora. It is buried in
      the pit, but the Silent Death has protected it from blasphemy&mdash;and
      besides Man Alexander never learned about it. We feared that he would
      destroy it as he did Lyssa's tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild hope stirred in Kennon. "We're going home," he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we're going to get a pair of radiation suits&mdash;and then we're
      coming back. We'll have a good look at that Pit, and if what's in there is
      what I think it is"&mdash;his face was a mixture of grimness and eagerness&mdash;"we'll
      blow this whole operation off this planet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper blanched. "It is death to meddle with the God-Egg," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Superstition!" Kennon scoffed. "If that Egg is what I think, it was made
      by men, and you are their descendant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you're right, but I can't help thinking you are wrong," she said
      soberly. "Look at the trouble that came with Roga's meddling. Be careful
      that you do not bring us a worse fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be very careful. We'll take every precaution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're coming, of course. I can't imagine you staying away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't worry so much," Kennon teased. "You know we men live
      forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I'm right you're just as human as I. And you're capable of living
      as long as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," Copper said. Her voice was unconvinced, her expression
      noncommittal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You females," Kennon said in quick exasperation. "You drive a man crazy.
      Get an idea in your head and it takes triatomate to blast it out. Now
      let's go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours brought them back to the volcanic area, and knowing what to look
      for, Kennon located the pockmarked mountain valley. From the air it looked
      completely ordinary. Kennon was amazed at the perfection of the natural
      camouflage. The Pit was merely another crater in the pitted ground. He
      dropped to a lower altitude, barely a hundred feet above the sputter
      cones. "Look!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below them was the crater of the Pit and in its center a smooth
      bluish-black hemisphere protruded from the crater floor. It would have
      passed unnoticed by the casual eye&mdash;nearly concealed by two gigantic
      blocks of pumice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The God-Egg!" Copper exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egg&mdash;ha! that's a spacer! I thought it would be. I'd recognize
      durilium anywhere. Let's go down and look this over, but first we want a
      couple of pictures." He pointed a camera at the crater and snapped the
      shutter. "There&mdash;now let's have a closer look at our baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you expect me to get into that thing?" Copper said distastefully as
      she prodded the shapeless green coveralls with a bare toe. She eyed the
      helmet, gloves and boots with equal distaste. "I'd suffocate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want to come with me, you'll wear it," Kennon said. "Otherwise you
      won't come near that pit. Try it and I'll chain you to the jeep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just try me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;all right. I'll wear the thing&mdash;but I won't be
      comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who cares about that? You'll be protected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;show me how to put it on. I'd rather be with you than
      worry about what you are doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The suit was several sizes too large but it covered her adequately. Too
      adequately, Kennon decided. She looked like a pile of wrinkles with legs.
      He chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glared. "So I'm funny," she said. "Let me tell you something else
      that's funny. I'm hot. I'm sweating. I itch. Now&mdash;laugh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't feel like laughing," Kennon said. "I feel the same way."
    </p>
    <p>
      They approached the edge of the Pit carefully. Kennon kept checking the
      radiation counter. The needle slowly rose and steadied at one-half
      roentgen per hour as he thrust the probe over the rim of the depression.
      "It's fine, so far," he said encouragingly. "We could take this much for
      quite a while even without suits." He lowered himself over the edge,
      sliding down the gentle slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it down there?" Copper called. The intercom crackled in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine&mdash;barely over one roentgen per hour. With these suits we could
      stay here indefinitely." The sigh of relief was music in her ears. "This
      place is barely lukewarm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what you think," Copper said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean radiation warm," Kennon said. "Stay up there and watch me. I may
      need some things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right." Copper squirmed inside the hot suit. The thing was an oven.
      She hoped that Kennon didn't plan to work in the daytime. It would be
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon gingerly approached the ship. It was half buried in the loose
      debris and ash that had fallen or blown into the pit during the centuries
      it had rested there. It was old&mdash;incredibly old. The hull design was
      ancient&mdash;riveted sheets of millimeter-thick durilium. Ships hadn't
      been built like that in over two thousand years. And the ovoid shape was
      reminiscent of the even more ancient spindizzy design. A hyperspace
      converter like that couldn't be less than four millennia old. It was a
      museum piece, but the blue-black hull was as smooth and unblemished as the
      day it had left fabrication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space travel would have gotten nowhere without durilium, Kennon reflected.
      For five thousand years men had used the incredibly tough synthetic to
      build their spacecraft. It had given man his empire. Kennon gave the hull
      one quick glance. That part of the ship didn't worry him. It was what he
      would find inside that bothered him. How much damage had occurred from two
      thousand or more years of disuse? How much had the original travelers
      cannibalized? How much could be salvaged? What sort of records remained?
      There were a thousand questions that the interior of that enigmatic hull
      might answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upper segment of the airlock was visible. It was closed, which was a
      good sign. A few hours' work with a digger should expose it enough to be
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Copper," he said, "we're going to have to dig this out. There's a small
      excavator in the cargo bed of the jeep. Do you think you can bring it down
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good girl!" Kennon turned back to the ship. He was eager to enter it.
      There might be things inside that would settle the question of the Lani.
      The original crew had probably recognized the value of the hull as a
      repository as well as he did. But in the meantime there would be work&mdash;lots
      of it. And every step must be recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the rest of the day's work to expose the emergency airlock. The
      little excavator toiled over the loose ash for hours before it displaced
      enough to make the port visible, and the ash was not yet cleared away
      sufficiently to open the portal when darkness brought a halt to the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be impossible to unearth the spaceship with their low-capacity
      digger, Kennon decided. It would be difficult enough to clear the
      emergency airlock in the nose. But if the tubes and drive were still all
      right, by careful handling it should be possible to use the drive to blast
      out the loose ash and cinders which surrounded the hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon reluctantly gave up the idea of entering the spaceship. That would
      have to wait until tomorrow. Now they would have to conceal the work and
      call it a day. A few branches and the big blocks of pumice would suffice
      for temporary camouflage. Later they could make something better. Anything
      in the jeep which might be useful was cached along with the radiation
      suits in the passageway through the lava wall&mdash;and in a surprisingly
      short time they were heading homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon was not too displeased. Tomorrow they would be able to enter the
      ship. Tomorrow they would probably have some of the answers to his
      questions. He looked ahead into the gathering night. The gray mass of the
      abandoned Olympus Station slipped below them as he lined the jeep along
      the path indicated by the luminous arrow atop the main building, set the
      controls on automatic, and locked the craft on the guide beacon in
      Alexandria's tower. In a little less than an hour they would be home.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kennon was morally certain that the Lani were of human stock. Evolved, of
      course. Mutated. Genetic strangers to the rest of humanity. But human. The
      spaceship and the redes proved it as far as he was concerned. But moral
      certainty and legal certainty were two different things. What he believed
      might be good enough to hold up in a Brotherhood court, but he doubted it.
      Ulf and Lyssa might be the founders of the Lani race, but they had come to
      Kardon nearly four thousand years ago and no records existed to prove that
      the Lani weren't here before they came. Redes passed by word of mouth
      through hundreds of generations were not evidence. Even the spaceship
      wasn't the absolute proof that would be needed to overturn the earlier
      legal decision. Other and better proof was needed&mdash;something that
      would stand up in any court in the Brotherhood. He hoped the spaceship
      would hold that proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kennon's eagerness to find out what was inside the ancient spacer was
      tempered by hard practicality. Too much depended on what he might find
      inside that hull. Every step of the work must be documented beyond any
      refutation. Some method of establishing date, time, and location had to be
      prepared. There must be a record of every action. And that would require
      equipment and planning. There must be no mistake that could be twisted by
      the skillful counsel that Alexander undoubtedly retained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no doubt that the Family would fight. Too much money and prestige
      were involved. To prove the Lani human would destroy Outworld Enterprises
      on Kardon. Yet this thought did not bother him. To his surprise he had no
      qualms of conscience. He was perfectly willing to violate his contract,
      break faith with his employers, and plot their ruin. The higher duty came
      first&mdash;the duty to the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled wryly. It wasn't all higher duty. There were some personal
      desires that leavened the nobility. To prove Copper human was enough
      motivation&mdash;actually it was better than his sense of duty. Events,
      Kennon reflected, cause a great deal of change in one's attitude. Although
      not by nature a plotter, schemes had been flitting through his mind with
      machinelike regularity, to be examined and discarded, or to be set aside
      for future reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rejected the direct approach. It was too dangerous, depended too much
      on personalities, and had too little chance for success. He considered the
      possibility of letters to the Brotherhood Council but ultimately rejected
      it. Not only was the proof legally insufficient to establish humanity in
      the Lani, but he also remembered Alexander's incredible knowledge of his
      activities, and there was no reason to suppose that his present didn't
      receive the same scrutiny as the past. And if he, who hadn't written a
      letter in over a year, suddenly began to write, the correspondence would
      undoubtedly be regarded with suspicion and would probably be examined, and
      Dirac messages would be out for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could take a vacation and while he was away from the island he could
      inform the Brotherhood. Leaving Flora wouldn't be particularly difficult,
      but leaving Kardon would be virtually impossible. His contract called for
      vacations, but it expressly provided that they would be taken on Kardon.
      And again, there would be no assurance that his activities would not be
      watched. In fact, it was probable that they would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing that could be done immediately. But there were certain
      long-range measures that could be started. He could begin preparing a case
      that could be presented to the Council. And Beta, when it knew, would help
      him. The situation of the Lani was so close to Beta's own that its obvious
      merit as a test case simply could not be ignored. If he could get the
      evidence to Beta, it would be easy to enlist the aid of the entire
      Medico-Technological Civilization. It would take time and attention to
      detail; the case, the evidence, everything would have to be prepared with
      every safeguard and contingency provided, so that there would not be the
      slightest chance of a slip-up once it came to court.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps the best method of bringing the evidence would be to transport
      it under its own power. The thought intrigued him. Actually it wouldn't be
      too difficult. Externally the Egg wasn't in bad shape. The virtually
      indestructible durilium hull was still intact. The controls and the
      engines, hermetically sealed inside the hull, were probably as good as the
      day they stopped running. The circuitry would undoubtedly be bad but it
      could be repaired and restored, and new fuel slugs could be obtained for
      the engine and the converter. But that was a problem for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate problem was to get into the ship in a properly documented
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took nearly two months, but finally, under the impersonal lenses of
      cameras and recorders, the entrance port of the God-Egg swung open and
      revealed the dark interior. Kennon moved carefully, recording every step
      as he entered the black orifice in the spaceship's side. His handtorch
      gave plenty of light for the recorders as he moved inside&mdash;Copper at
      his heels, both of them physically unrecognizable in antiradiation suits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are we moving so slowly?" Copper said. "Let's go ahead and find out
      what's beyond this passageway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From a superstitious coward you've certainly become a reckless explorer,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Egg hasn't hurt us, and we've been around it many times," she said.
      "Either the curse has become too old to hurt us, or there never was any in
      the first place. So let's see what is ahead. I'm curious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. "In this business we must hurry slowly&mdash;very
      slowly. You know why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patience, girl. Simmer down. You'll see soon enough," Kennon said. "Now
      help me set up this camera."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right&mdash;but isn't there any excitement in you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm bubbling over with it," Kennon admitted, "but I manage to keep it
      under control."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're cold-blooded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I'm sensible. We want to nail this down. My future, yours, and
      that of your people depend upon how carefully we work. You wouldn't want
      to let us all down by being too eager, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "No&mdash;you're right of course. But I still would
      like to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved cautiously through the airlock and into the control room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" Kennon said with satisfaction. "I hoped for this, but I didn't dare
      expect it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look around. What do you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing but an empty room. It's shaped like half an orange, and it has a
      lot of funny instruments and dials on the walls, and a video screen
      overhead. But that's all. Why&mdash;what's so unusual about it? It looks
      just like someone had left it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the point. There's nothing essential that's missing. They didn't
      cannibalize the instruments&mdash;and they didn't come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe because that curse you mentioned a few minutes ago was real."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper drew back. "But you said it wouldn't hurt us&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now. The heat's practically gone, but when whoever flew this crate
      came here, the whole shell could have been as hot as a Samarian summer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But couldn't they have come back when it cooled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not with this kind of heat. The hull was probably too radioactive to
      approach from the outside. And radioactivity cools off slowly. It might
      take several lifetimes for its level to become low enough to approach if
      there was no decontamination equipment available."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that's why the early ones thought the Egg was cursed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. "Now let's check&mdash;oh! oh! what's this?" He pointed to
      a metal-backed book lying on the control panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks like a book," Copper said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm hoping it's the book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;the ship's log. It's possible. And if it is, we may have all
      the evidence we need&mdash;Copper!&mdash;Don't touch it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because its position has to be recorded first. Wait until we get the
      camera and recorders set up."
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Gingerly Kennon opened the ancient book. The sheets inside were brittle&mdash;crumbling
      with age&mdash;but he could make out the title U.N.S.S. Wanderer with the
      date of launching and a lower line which read "Ship's Log." Kennon was
      thankful for his medical training. The four years of Classical English
      that he had despised so much were essential now. Stumbling over unfamiliar
      words and phrases, he moved slowly through the log tracing the old ship's
      history from pleasure craft to short-haul freight tractor to obsolescence
      in a space dump orbiting around a world called Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gap of nearly ten years indicated by a blank page before the
      entries resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah&mdash;this is it!" Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" Copper said curiously. "I can't read the writing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can't. It's in English&mdash;a language that became
      obsolete during the Interregnum. I had to learn it, since most medical
      terminology is based on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is an Interregnum?" Copper interrupted. "I've never heard that word
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a period of confusion when there is no stable government. The last
      one came after the Second Galactic War&mdash;but never mind that&mdash;it
      happened long ago and isn't important now. The important thing that did
      happen was the Exodus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A religious revival and a tremendous desire to see what was happening
      beyond the next star. During that century men traveled wider and farther
      then they ever have before or since. In that outward explosion with its
      mixed motivations of religion and practicality, colonists and missionaries
      went starward to find new worlds to tame, and new races to be rescued from
      the darkness of idolatry and hell. Almost any sort of vehicle capable of
      mounting a spindizzy converter was pressed into service. The old
      spindizzies were soundly engineered converters of almost childlike
      simplicity that could and did carry ships enormous distances if their
      passengers didn't care about subjective time-lag, and a little
      radioactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that's what happened to this ship. According to this log it was
      bought by Alfred and Melissa Weygand&mdash;a missionary couple with the
      idea of spreading the Christian faith to the heathen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alfred and Melissa&mdash;Ulf and Lyssa&mdash;they were a part of this
      ancient explosion that scattered human seed across parsecs of interstellar
      space. It seems that they were a unit in a missionary fleet that had gone
      out to the stars with flame in their hearts and Gospel on their lips to
      bring the Word to the benighted heathen on other worlds." Kennon's lips
      curled with mild contempt at their stupid foolhardiness even as his pulse
      quickened to their bravery. They had been fanatics, true enough, but
      theirs was a selfless fanaticism that would risk torture and death for
      what they believed&mdash;a fanaticism that was more sublime than the
      concept of Brotherhood which had evolved from it. They knew nothing of the
      enmity of race, of the incessant struggle man had since waged with alien
      intelligences all too willing to destroy intruders who encroached upon
      their worlds. Mankind's early selflessness had long ago been discarded for
      frank expansionism and dominance over the lesser races that stood in their
      way. And in a way it was too bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship's log, meticulously kept in neat round English script, told a
      story that was more than the bare bones of flight. There was passion and
      tenderness and a spiritual quality that was shocking to a modern man
      steeped in millennia of conquest and self-interest. There was a greatness
      to it, a depth of faith that had since been lost. And as Kennon slowly
      deciphered the ancient script he admired the courage even as his mind
      winced with dismay at the unheeding recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Weygands had lost contact with the others, and had searched for them
      in hyperspace, doubling and twisting upon their course until they had
      become hopelessly lost, and then, with their fuel nearly exhausted, had
      broken out into the normal three-space continuum to find Kardon's sun and
      the world they called Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      How little they had known and how lucky they had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only by the grace of their God that they had found this world
      before their fuel was exhausted. And it was only by further grace that the
      planet was habitable and not populated with intelligent life. They had
      more luck than people were entitled to in a dozen lifetimes. Against odds
      of a million to one they had survived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fascinating reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last entry read: "We have circled this world and have seen no
      buildings&mdash;no sign of intelligent life. We are lost, marooned on this
      empty world. Our fuel supplies are too low for us to attempt to find the
      others. Nor could we. The constellations in the sky are strange. We do not
      know which way to go. Therefore we shall land upon the great island in the
      center of the yellow sea. And perhaps someday men will come to us since we
      cannot return to them. Melissa thinks that this is an example of Divine
      Providence, that the Lord's mercy has been shown to us that were lost in
      the vastness of the deep&mdash;that we have been chosen, like Eve and
      Adam, to spread the seed of man to yet another world. I hope she is right,
      yet I fear the radiation level of the ship has become inordinately high.
      We may well be Eve and Adam, yet an Adam that cannot beget and an Eve that
      is not fruitful. I am trimming the ship for landing, and we shall leave it
      immediately after we have landed, taking with us only what we absolutely
      need. There is too much radiation from the spindizzy and the drive to
      remain here longer&mdash;and God knows how hot the outer hull may be."
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all. Presumptive evidence&mdash;yes. Reasonable certainty&mdash;yes.
      But not proof. Lawyers could argue that since no direct exploration was
      made there was no valid reason to assume that the Lani did not already
      inhabit Kardon. But Kennon knew. His body, more perceptive than his mind,
      had realized a truth that his brain would not accept until he read the
      log. It was at once joy and frustration. Joy that Copper was human,
      frustration that he could not obtain for her and her race the rights to
      which they were entitled. But the immediate problem was solved. His
      conditioning was broken now he was convinced that Copper was a member of
      the human race. It was no violation of his code to love her. The greatest
      barrier was broken, and with it gone the lesser ones would yield. Relief
      that was almost pain washed through him and left him weak with reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" Copper asked as he turned to her. "What is this thing that
      has turned your face to joy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you guess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "I have seen nothing but you reading this ancient
      book, yet you turn to me with the look in your eyes that the redes say Ulf
      had for Lyssa."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're human!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper shrugged. "You're mad. I'm a Lani. I was born a Lani&mdash;and I
      shall die one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you understand? All Lani are human. You all are the descendants of
      two humans who came here thousands of years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then there is no reason why you cannot love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. "No," he said. "There is no reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper laughed. It was a sound so merry and gay that Kennon looked at her
      in surprise. She looked as happy as she sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simple and savage, Kennon thought. She cared nothing for the future, and
      probably very little about the injustice of her present. The thing that
      mattered was that what had kept them apart was gone. She was probably
      offering mental sacrifices to the Old Ones who had caused this change in
      the man she loved. She didn't really care about what had caused the
      change. To her it was sufficient that it had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Kennon wished that it could be as simple for him as it
      apparently was for her. The fact that Copper was human posed a greater
      problem than the one it solved. The one had been personal. The other was
      infinitely greater. He could not let it lie. The very morality which had
      kept him from doing what he wished when he thought she was a humanoid now
      forced him to do what he did not wish. Every instinct said to leave it
      alone. The problem was too great for one man to solve, the situation too
      complicated, the evidence too inconclusive, the opposition too powerful.
      It would be far better to take his happiness and enjoy it. It was not his
      problem to solve. He could turn the evidence over to the Brotherhood once
      his contract was over, and better and more capable people than he could
      settle the Lani legal status. But the inner voice that had called him
      bestial now called him shirker, coward, and slacker. And this, too, could
      not be borne. The case of the Lani would have to be pursued as vigorously
      as he could do it. They were entitled to human rights&mdash;whether they
      wanted them or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first idea of making the spacer operational was a good one, Kennon
      decided as they finished the inspection of the ship. Even if it was never
      used it would make a good means of retreat. He grinned wryly. In a
      guerrilla operation such as the one he was considering it would be wise to
      have a way out if things got too hot. The heavy parts, the engines and the
      controls, were in workable condition and would merely require cleaning and
      oiling. Some of the optical equipment would have to be replaced and fuel
      slugs would have to be obtained for the drive&mdash;but none of these
      would be too hard to accomplish. The slugs from any of the power reactors
      on the island would serve nicely. All that would have to be done would be
      to modify the fuel ports on the ship's engine. The spindizzy would have to
      be disassembled and checked, and the main leads, embedded in
      time-resistant plastic, would have to be examined. The most serious
      problem, however, wouldn't involve these things. The control board wiring
      and circuitry was where the trouble would lie. Normal insulation and
      printed circuitry wasn't designed to last for thousands of years. Each
      wired circuit would have to be removed, duplicated, and replaced. Every
      printed panel would have to be cleaned and receive a new coat of
      insulating varnish. Working full time, a four-man electronics team could
      do the job in a week. Working part-time the two of them might get it done
      in three months. And the other jobs would take at least another. Add a
      month for errors in judgment, lack of materials, and mistakes&mdash;and
      another for unavoidable delays&mdash;it would be at least six months
      before the Egg would be spaceworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not too long if everything went well, but far too long if there were any
      mistakes. He would have to be careful, yet he must not give the impression
      of being careful. He shook his head. Being a subversive was going to
      require a greater amount of acting ability than he had ever been called
      upon to display.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what of Copper? How would she behave under the double strain of
      knowledge that she was human and knowledge of the spaceship? Women weren't
      noted for their tight-lipped reticence. Would she tell the other Lani?
      Would she crack under the pressure? Did she have the qualities of a good
      conspirator?
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turned out, he didn't need to worry. As a partner in crime, Copper
      was all that could be wished. Everything was normal. She was still
      obedient, helpful, and gay as ever. To watch her, no one would ever think
      that her bright head was full of knowledge that could rock Flora to its
      foundations. Never by look or word did she betray the slightest trace of
      strain or guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in her other moments she was ecstatic in her love and helpful with the
      repair work on the Egg whenever Kennon could get time to visit the old
      spaceship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You amaze me," Kennon said as they eased the cover of the spindizzy in
      place and spun the bolts on the lugs that held it to the outer shielding.
      He picked up a heavy wrench and began methodically to seat the bolts as
      Copper wiped the white extrusion of the cover sealant from the shining
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The way you hide your knowledge of this ship from the others. I know you
      better than anyone else on this island, and yet you would fool me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We Lani are used to hiding things. You men have been our masters for
      centuries, yet you do not know our redes. Nor do you know what we think,
      We obey you, but there are parts of us you do not own. It is easy to hide
      a little thing like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. It figured. He seated another bolt. Three more and the
      drive room would be restored and they could start on the control circuits.
      "I wish you were as clever about adopting human customs as you are about
      hiding guilty knowledge," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper laughed. "You mean those silly things you have been teaching me?
      Why should I learn them? I'm happy as I am. I love you, you love me, and
      that is all that matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not all that matters. Can't you get it through your head that
      civilized customs are necessary in a civilized society?" He gave the
      next-to-last bolt an extra-vicious wrench. "You'll have to know them if
      you expect to get along on Beta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I will never see Beta."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going there when my duty here is over. And you're going with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will that be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long? Well&mdash;we can think of it then, but I don't think Man
      Alexander will let you take me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall take you without his consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. "It would be easier to stay here. In another fifteen years I
      will be old and you will not want me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never do that. I'll always want you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You swear too easily," she said gently. "You men live forever. We Lani
      are a short-lived race."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you needn't be. It's obviously&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been tried, my love&mdash;and those who were treated died. Man
      Alexander tried many years ago to make us long-lived like you. But he
      failed. You see, he loved one of us too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us think no more of it. Let us enjoy what we have and be grateful to
      the Gods for the love we enjoy&mdash;or do you have any Gods?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two are better. More, anyway. And besides, Ulf and Lyssa and the God-Egg
      are responsible for our joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are indeed," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why should you think of leaving the place where they rule? You
      should stay here. There will be other Lani when I am gone. You will be
      happy always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not without you," Kennon said. "Don't you understand that I love you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I you. But I am a Lani. You are a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're as human as I am," Kennon said abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is what you say," Copper replied. "I am not so sure. I need more
      proof than this." She waved her hand at the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What proof do you need?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same as the proof you men require. If I should have your child, then
      I would believe that I was human."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've told you a thousand times that the radiation on this ship must have
      affected Ulf and Lyssa's germ plasm. Can't you understand that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can understand it all right, but it does not change things. Ulf and
      Lyssa may have been human before they came here, but they were not when
      they landed. They were Lani, and their children were Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they were of human stock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The law that lets men become our masters does not agree with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the law is wrong. It should be changed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper shrugged. "Two people cannot change a law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They can try&mdash;particularly if the law is unjust."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper sighed. "Is it not enough for us to love? Must you try to run
      through a wall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the wall stands in the way of right and justice I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper looked at him with pity in her green eyes. "This I do not
      understand. I know nothing of right and justice. What are these things?
      Just words. Yet you will endanger our happiness for them. If it is my
      happiness you wish&mdash;then leave this foolishness alone. I have fifteen
      years I can live with you before I am old and you tire of me. With those
      years I can be content."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can't," Kennon said. "Call me selfish if you wish, but I want you
      with me as long as I live. I don't want to live my life without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want too much," Copper said softly. "But if it makes you happy to try
      to get it, I shall help. And if we do not succeed you will at least be
      happier for trying. And if you are happy"&mdash;she shrugged&mdash;"then
      the rest makes little difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the crux of the matter, Kennon reflected bitterly. He was
      convinced she was human. She was not. And until her mind could be changed
      on that point she would help him but her heart wouldn't be in it. And the
      only thing that would convince her that she was human would be a child&mdash;a
      child of his begetting. He could perhaps trick her with an artificial
      insemination of Lani sperm. There were drugs that could suspend
      consciousness, hypnotics that would make her believe anything she was told
      while under their influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the end it would do no good. All witnesses in Brotherhood court
      actions were examined under psychoprobe, and a hypnotic was of no value
      against a lie detector that could extract the deepest buried truth. And he
      would be examined too. The truth would out&mdash;and nothing would be
      gained. In fact&mdash;everything would be lost. The attempt at trickery
      would prejudice any court against the honest evidence they had so
      painfully collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. The only thing to do was to go on as they were&mdash;and hope
      that the evidence would hold. With Betan legal talent at their back it
      might. And, of course, they could try to produce a child as nature had
      intended. They could try&mdash;but Kennon knew it would not succeed. It
      never had.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Copper had been acting strangely of late, Kennon thought as he rolled over
      in his bed and watched her standing before the full-length mirror on the
      bathroom door. She pivoted slowly before the glass, eying herself
      critically, raising her arms over her head, holding them at her sides,
      flexing her supple spine and tightening muscles that moved like silken
      cords beneath her golden skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you trying to do&mdash;become a muscle dancer?" Kennon asked
      idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She whirled, a crimson blush deepening the tan of her face. "You were
      supposed to be asleep," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm an unregenerate heel," he replied, "and I don't sleep too well
      nowadays unless you're beside me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;I suppose you might as well know now as later," she said.
      "You'll know in any event."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you're right. I am human."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what brought on this sudden change of&mdash;" He stopped abruptly,
      his eyes widening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," Copper said. "I am with child. Your child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "It's a miracle perhaps, but it's not impossible. It's
      happened. Can't you see the difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See what? You look just as you always do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you can't see it yet," she admitted. "But I am with child. I'm
      two weeks past my time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon's mind leaped to the obvious conclusion. Pseudo-pregnancy. He had
      seen it before among Lani at Hillside Farm. It was an odd syndrome which
      occasionally occurred in humans and animals. The brain, desiring children,
      made demands upon the body and the body responded to its desire by
      tricking the brain. Lani were fairly subject to its probably because they
      had better imaginations. He would run a few tests when they went down to
      the hospital, and once she realized the practical joke her body was
      playing everything would be all right. No wonder she seemed excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll find out about that later," he said equably. "We'll settle this
      when we get back to the hospital."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper smiled confidently and patted her stomach. "I know what you are
      thinking, but you're wrong. We Lani know about these things. In forty
      generations I am the first to conceive as the Master intended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you haven't," Kennon said with such bitter sincerity that Copper
      looked at him wide-eyed. "Not now. Because if you have, neither your life
      nor mine is safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Alexanders. Do you think they'll take it lying down? We're not ready
      for them yet. They'll fight, and the first thing they'll do is kill you
      and erase me so we would never be able to talk. You have been declared an
      animal, and you will not be allowed to change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can we do?" Copper asked. She shivered. "I do not want to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I want you to," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could tell the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And just what would that accomplish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a week every Lani on the island would know it. There would be revolt.
      For the Lani would no longer be dependent upon Men to survive. Their
      greatest hold on us would be gone. And we would be free again on our
      island world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not!" Kennon said. "That sort of thinking is foolishness.
      Alexander would have men here within a week, and a week after that you
      would be smashed. Don't you realize that there are thousands of millions
      of men in the galaxy&mdash;and to every one of them you would be animals.
      You know nothing about what you would face. Your puny hundreds couldn't
      even stand against a fraction of the power Alexander could mount against
      you. Have you seen a Burkholtz blaster work? Have you seen remote-control
      antipersonnel missiles? Have you push-pull projectors, atomic warheads?
      All of these weapons Alexander can command. Don't you realize he's an
      entrepreneur?&mdash;one of the most powerful men in this sector?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper shook her head. "No," she said in a small voice. "I know nothing
      about these things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think forty generations of absolute obedience to men can be
      overcome because one Lani says she is pregnant by a man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper frowned. "You put that in a different way. You talk as if it were
      my belief rather than the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is truth?" Kennon said heavily. "Who would believe you? There are
      hundreds of others with child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure you're human. You know it. I know it. I've been trying to convince
      you for the past two months. You're just as human as I am. But pray that
      you're not pregnant. We can't get out of here in less than four months and
      by then everybody will know about you. Someone will certainly check the
      records. And after that will come the psychoprobes. Everything will come
      to light. The Egg will be destroyed. I will be erased. You will be dead.
      And that will be the end of it." He looked down at her with an odd
      expression of pity on his face. "You see?" he demanded harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper nodded. "I didn't understand," she said. "Don't be angry with me. I
      shouldn't have told you. I thought you'd be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was never angry with you, but I am with myself. I was stupid. I didn't
      figure on the remote possibility that we might be genetically compatible.
      I should have my head examined for putting you in such danger. However
      there's the possibility&mdash;the probability&mdash;that your body is
      playing a trick upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "You are wrong. I am not mistaken. I am with child and
      the child is yours. But the fault is no more yours than mine. I wanted you
      before you looked on me. I still do and I do not feel at fault. That I am
      yours, that my child is yours is a thing of wonder and joy. Never could I
      have expected so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked down at her smudged face, streaked with the sudden rivulets
      of tears, and bitterness galled his throat. Dear God&mdash;let her be
      wrong, he prayed silently. Let it be pseudopregnancy this time. Let the
      tests be negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they weren't. Unequivocally they confirmed Copper's diagnosis. Here
      was the proof he needed. The final test that would prove the Lani human.
      And he had no way of getting it where it would do any good. It would take
      at least four months of steady labor before the ship was ready, and he
      didn't have that sort of time. He was needed here and his prolonged
      absence would cause suspicion and investigation. Something would have to
      be done&mdash;but what? He couldn't take Copper off the island in an
      airboat. They were checked with microscopic care by Otpen One's IFF. A
      jeep didn't have enough range to take them to the mainland. And even if
      they got there they couldn't get off the planet. Alexander knew everything
      that happened on Kardon's two spaceports. The Egg was the only way, but
      the Egg was unfinished and unspaceworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantically Kennon considered concealing Copper. He shook his head. It
      wouldn't work. It would be impossible, to hide a baby on a place where
      every birth was recorded. Nor could one hide evidence of pregnancy in a
      Lani. Childbearing leaves telltale marks upon the body, and Copper, even
      if she could be concealed for the duration of her pregnancy, could never
      survive the sharp-eyed scrutiny of her fellows or the other humans.
      Questions would inevitably be asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had to be a solution. He rubbed his forehead wearily. It was strange
      how so little a thing as the union of a spermatozoon and an ovum could
      produce so much trouble. He looked across the office at Copper placidly
      filing case cards. She wasn't worrying. With sublime faith, she was sure
      that he would find the answer, the one that would solve everything. He
      shuddered. The only logical solution was abortion&mdash;and that was
      unthinkable! He would not murder his child&mdash;nor would Copper permit
      it if he was capable of doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost a relief when his phone rang and Blalok's voice came
      cheerfully across the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tried to get you about an hour ago," the superintendent said, "but your
      girl said you were busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You through now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, get up to the fortress. Alexander just flew in and he's calling a
      meeting. Something important has come up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something important! A wave of ice rattled down Kennon's spine, and then
      he grinned feebly. Alexander didn't know. He couldn't know. It had to be
      something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be right up," he said, marveling at the calmness in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon couldn't help comparing this meeting with the one a year ago. The
      location was different&mdash;the conference room in Alexandria was more
      formal than Blalok's parlor but the same people were present: Alexander,
      Blalok, Jordan, and himself. Somehow Alexander seemed to have shrunk. He
      was no longer as impressive as he had been. But the man still radiated
      force, even though it didn't seem quite so overpowering. The year, Kennon
      thought, had done much to build his self-confidence. He felt assured
      rather than nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good to see you, Kennon," Alexander said. "Reports say you're doing a
      good job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't claim the credit," Kennon said. "Eighty-five per cent of our
      success is due to co-operation from the operating staff. And that's
      Blalok's doing&mdash;he knocked the heads of the division managers
      together and they took care of their staffs. Otherwise we could have had a
      bad time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you didn't," Alexander said. "And you were the motive force."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've darn near motivated myself out of a job," Kennon said. "They
      co-operate all too well nowadays."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which goes to prove that my theories on preventive medicine are right,"
      Alexander said, turning to Blalok.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks that way," Blalok admitted, "but that could be because you
      picked a good man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's good in more ways than one," Alexander said. "Or did he tell you he
      saved Douglas's life out on Otpen One?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's never said a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander smiled. "Another point in his favor. He knows how to keep his
      mouth shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when he's telling someone what to do about disease," Jordon
      interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or telling someone off when they haven't followed directions," Blaiok
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better and better. I was sure that he was the one we needed when we first
      met."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon felt his ears turn flaming red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's not the reason I brought you here. This isn't a Jac Kennon
      admiration society. I called you because I want to expand the Lani
      breeding program."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" Jordan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok stiffened. "You know my feeling about that, sir. I've never liked
      the idea of selling them. If that's what's in your mind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander shook his head. "Simmer down," he said, as he seated himself at
      the head of the table. "There's going to be no selling. The Lani are too
      valuable for that. We'll need them more than the money they'd bring on the
      market. You see&mdash;I've acquired a planet out on the periphery. A place
      called Phoebe. One of our ships found it, and I staked a discovery claim
      on the major land mass, and the crew made lesser claims that covered all
      the available land. Last month the Brotherhood allowed the claims. Last
      week the crewmen sold me their land. Phoebe's a lovely place&mdash;quite a
      bit like Flora&mdash;and the ecological tests show it's capable of
      supporting mammalian life. Just before I came here I sent three shiploads
      of exterminators to clean it up and make it ready for us. It should be
      ready in two years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of an ecology are you exterminating?" Jordan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that it makes any difference," Alexander said, "but it's mainly
      reptilian. Nothing over Group I. We'll restock with Floran animals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan sighed. "Since that's the way it is, it doesn't make any
      difference," he said. "But it could have. The Lani are sensitive to things
      like that. If they thought that they were walking in over a pile of bodies
      they'd do badly. It'd be like Olympus all over again. And we couldn't keep
      them from knowing. We talk and we forget, but they'd tell each other&mdash;and
      they'd remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," Alexander said, "somehow they've never forgotten that
      Grandfather trapped the last of the Lani males on Olympus."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jordan nodded. "They can't stand the place. That's why we had to abandon
      the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does this new world have a moon?" Kennon asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;in fact it has two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Habitable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;they're too small to hold air. But men could live there in domes&mdash;but
      why do you?&mdash;oh! I see! I hadn't considered that point." Alexander's
      hand darted to the phone beside him. "Get me Albertsville," he snapped.
      "Yes, my offices&mdash;I want Mr. Oliver in purchasing and contracting.
      Hello&mdash;Ward? Alexander here. Yes&mdash;everything's fine. I have a
      job for you&mdash;use your scrambler-pattern two." Alexander dialed the
      scrambler code on the second dial at the base of the phone, effectively
      preventing eavesdropping by beam tappers. "Yes," he went on. "It's Project
      Phoebe. Have you secured title to the moons? You haven't? Well&mdash;you'd
      better do it before some of our competitors get bright ideas. Sure they
      know about the project&mdash;do you think they're stupid? Warren over at
      Consolidated practically told me that he was onto our scheme. So get title
      to those moons. Since they're uninhabitable and within the planet's
      primary field they come under the Spatial Debris Act and you should be
      able to get Kardonian title without any great amount of trouble. Naturally
      we want them.&mdash;For defense&mdash;what else? We'll have most of our
      eggs in that basket. No&mdash;I don't know how we overlooked that point.
      But if it wasn't for a bright young man out here we'd have left ourselves
      wide open. Now get cracking&mdash;get that leak plugged!" Alexander
      dropped the phone back in its cradle and sighed. "Well&mdash;that's
      buttoned up," he said. "Thanks, Kennon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked at Alexander's grinning face, his own impassive, but a
      shattering certainty exploded in his mind&mdash;Alexander was a telepath!
      That was his difference! That was the thing that made him feared and
      respected by his business associates. It wouldn't have been enough on the
      Central Worlds, where men knew of sensitives and took precautions against
      them. But out here on the periphery it was a deadly advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I gave it away," Alexander said. "I suppose I was careless, but your
      thoughts about the moons shocked me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You practically told me once before, when you hired me," Kennon said,
      "but I never realized it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were too excited then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't know," Kennon said. "At any rate I didn't add the facts
      correctly." From somewhere deep in his memory an old quip came floating to
      the surface: "An executive is a man who picks brains&mdash;others'
      brains." By that definition Alexander was an executive of the first class.
      Alexander chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Kennon wanted to run. Panic flooded him! What had he been
      thinking about? Had he thought of&mdash;two times two are four, four times
      four are sixteen, sixteen times sixteen are&mdash;let's see, six times
      sixteen is ninety-six, one times sixteen is&mdash;six, five, carry one&mdash;two&mdash;two
      hundred fifty-six. Two hundred fifty-six times&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's eating you?" Alexander demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm angry," Kennon said. "I told you the conditions I'd sign that
      contract, and you wrote a Peeper Clause into it. And then you peep in the
      worst way possible. There's no defense against a Telep unless you know
      about him; you've had my whole mind bare! You've violated my personal
      privacy like no man has done before. Sure I'm mad. I expected honesty from
      you&mdash;and you peep!" The anger was stronger now&mdash;a wave of raw
      emotion based on a lifetime of training in mutual respect of a man's
      privacy&mdash;a feeling intensified by his childhood environment of a
      crowded planetary ecology and the cramped crew quarters on a spaceship. To
      Kennon, Alexander had committed the ultimate sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see I made a mistake by not telling you," Alexander said. His voice
      was cold. "But you have no right to insult me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not saying it, am I?" Kennon snapped. The moonflower on the bookcase
      behind Alexander was a thing of beauty. Alexander liked beauty. He had
      said so, and the Great Hall below them bore it out. It was a lovely room.
      Those four bronze Lani in the fountain were works of art. One of them
      looked remarkably like Copper. Copper in bronze. The little witch had
      probably posed for the casting. Maybe it had even been made from her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're all of Susy," Alexander said. "I can see why you are angry, and I
      don't blame you. But remember I warned you about Lani."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper&mdash;Kennon wrenched his thoughts back to the moonflower. It had
      twelve petals, limpid white on the borders shading to deep blue in the
      center-from which the cream-colored stamen surrounded by transparent
      pistils sprang to burst into a golden glory of pollen that dripped in tiny
      yellow flecks to the broad petals below. It was a magnificent flower.
      There was nothing like it on Beta. That was a marvelous thing about
      flowers&mdash;wherever one went in the universe, plants used the same
      methods to fertilize their seed and spread their germ plasm. It was too
      bad that&mdash;Kennon jerked his attention to Alexander's face. He
      detested the thought that his mind was common property. A man should have
      something he can call his own. There had been a clinics instructor in Year
      Six who was a sensitive. The classes had protected themselves against his
      prying with a circlet&mdash;a thought screen&mdash;he had done it too.
      Maybe he had brought the circlet with him. If he did, no one was going to
      catch him without it. It was a dirty business, this reading of others'
      thought. Now where had he put that circlet? Was it among his old books&mdash;or
      was it with his instruments?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you go back to your house and find it?" Alexander snapped. "As
      you are, you're nothing but a disruption. I want you in on this meeting,
      but not the way you're acting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going to act any other way until I get some protection from
      peeping," Kennon said grimly. "And if you think this is bad wait till I
      start going through comparative anatomy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with you two?" Blalok asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be quiet," Alexander snapped. "This isn't your problem. Kennon is
      behaving like a spoiled child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a telepath!" Kennon said. "And he didn't tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So what? I've known that for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you stand for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a Mystic, not a Betan," Blalok said. "I don't have your insane desire
      for privacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go find that thought screen if you still have it!" Alexander said. "I
      don't want any more of this. You're making me ill!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon grinned thinly as he rose to his feet. It was a good thing he
      remembered Alexander was squeamish and didn't like anatomy. The door was
      to his left, an iris door with eight leaves&mdash;terribly old-fashioned.
      About ten steps away. Count them&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander sighed as Kennon left the room. "I certainly pushed the panic
      button on that young man," he said. "He has a pathological attitude toward
      telepathy. Wonder what he has to hide that he wants privacy so badly? Even
      for a Betan this reaction was violent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know. He's a pretty emotional sort. Maybe he hates to look
      like a fool. He's gotten himself mixed up with one of the Lani. Cute
      little thing by the name of Copper," Blalok said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;that's it. I thought that was what he was hiding. A picture of a
      girl kept popping up." Alexander chuckled. "I suppose that's the trouble.
      A man hardly likes to look a fool, particularly to someone who has warned
      him. At that, I don't blame him. They are beautiful and affectionate. And
      even with their superstitions and tabus they're better than most humans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For pets," Blalok said heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're not better at anything," Jordan demurred. "They can't be&mdash;man
      is the best and always will be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The eternal racial chauvinist," Alexander murmured. He turned his
      attention to Blalok. "But for awhile, Evald, I'd suggest you keep an eye
      on our young man. I still don't like his reaction. It was too violent&mdash;too
      defensive. I don't feel right about it. Perhaps Betans are more sensitive
      than most people but it seems to me that he's trying to conceal something.
      There was an undertone of fear&mdash;and something else&mdash;beneath his
      defenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't you get any more than that?" Blalok asked. "You're pretty good
      at this mind-reading business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His defenses were remarkably good," Alexander said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Well he'd done it now, Kennon thought. He found the thought-screen circlet
      sandwiched between two books on comparative neuroanatomy which he hadn't
      bothered to unpack. He slipped it on and connected the lead wires to a
      portable battery pack. There was a half-forgotten tingling as the weak
      field heterodyned his thought waves. Kennon sighed. If Alexander wasn't
      suspicious of him now the man was a fool. He'd done as well as he could
      with confusion and outrage, but it was hardly possible to hide behind
      superficialities. Even the most disciplined mind couldn't do that without
      some preparation. Undoubtedly his concern about Copper had leaked through.
      He could only hope that other and more important things had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;he could go back to the conference now, but he would have to be
      doubly careful from now on. He couldn't make daily trips to Olympus. His
      reaction had killed that plan. Alexander would be suspicious now&mdash;and
      unusual actions would crystallize suspicion to certainty. Now he needed a
      reason to be in that area. And then he grinned. He had a reason&mdash;a
      good one&mdash;one that would fit in with Alexander's plans and his own.
      The only problem would be to make Alexander buy it&mdash;and that might be
      difficult. He'd have to work carefully&mdash;but with normal luck he could
      put the idea across. He crossed his fingers as he trudged back up the path
      to Alexandria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference dragged on. Unlike most meetings, this one accomplished
      things&mdash;which was a tribute to Alexander's ability to keep the
      subject in hand. Details of the expansion program presented by Alexander
      were rapidly reduced to workable plans. They involved some rearrangement
      of existing facilities, and the construction of others. But the obvious
      snags were rapidly disposed of, and the whole revamped operation was
      outlined on paper in surprisingly few hours. A deadline date was set,
      construction was authorized, and in the morning the first steps in the
      practical implementation of the new program would be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's that," Alexander said with a sigh. "I think this calls for a
      drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one more thing," Kennon said. "I know it isn't much, but Jordan's
      remark started me thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What remark?" Jordan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one you made at the beginning about Phoebe possibly being like the
      Olympus Station. I've often wondered why that particular location has been
      so difficult to operate. Sure, I know the accepted explanation, but I
      think we should learn why it works and how to break a tabu. If we don't,
      we might be in for trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a good thought," Alexander said. "I tried to find out once, but
      all I could discover was that it was tabu. The Lani simply didn't like it.
      And despite the fact that I can read minds, I didn't learn any more than
      that. There's a certain sex-linkage to telepathy, as you probably know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I could discover was that their dislike of Olympus was a basic
      emotion rather than reasoned thought. They were nervous, irritable,
      disobedient, and uncooperative while they were there&mdash;and even they
      didn't know why. It was merely tabu. We even tried youngsters&mdash;but
      the attitude was the same. I'd like to know more about that basic
      emotion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We should understand it," Kennon agreed. "If we transship a large number
      of Lani to a strange world, we should know their deepest motivations. We
      cannot take the chance that the transplant won't take, with all the money
      you're sinking into this project."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a point there. Have you any suggestions about how to accomplish
      this?" Alexander's voice was interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have. Hire a psychologist. And reopen Olympus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll be the same story," Jordan said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if you apply experimental procedure," Kennon said. "Divide the place
      into a number of separate units in which groups of&mdash;say ten&mdash;Lani
      of various ages are kept. Let every group know where they are, but don't
      let them come in contact with one another. Observe them constantly. Put
      spy cells in the units. Couple them to recorders. Prepare a set of test
      situations and observe how each group performs. Question individuals under
      narcosynthesis. Observe and record any changes in physical condition&mdash;give
      them the works. Maybe we can collect some basic data that will indicate
      the answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bad idea," Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like it," Jordan said. "It sounds cumbersome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," Kennon agreed. "But it may save a great deal of trouble later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you're right, Kennon," Blalok said. "We should know everything we
      can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do first if you were heading this program?" Alexander
      asked. He eyed Kennon critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," Kennon said promptly. "I'm not qualified to run an
      investigation like this. You need a specialist. I am a practitioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hmm&mdash;but you know experimental procedure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally&mdash;but I do not have the training to prepare a program or
      evaluate its results. The only thing I could do would be to check the
      physical condition of the experimental groups."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you set up the physical facilities?" Alexander asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly&mdash;I'd need a set of plans of the station, and I couldn't
      guarantee that the specialist wouldn't want to make changes. But the
      physical arrangements should be simple enough to construct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long would it take you to prepare a plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could have it by tomorrow, or perhaps a day later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can do it by then I'll stay over. I'd like to examine this
      proposal more closely. It has merit. That's the second constructive
      suggestion you've made tonight. Despite your peculiar desire for privacy,
      I'm glad you came back." Alexander smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon smiled back. Apparently the entrepreneur had taken the bait. But it
      was too early to tell whether he had swallowed it without reservation. It
      all depended upon how much had been given away before he had discovered
      that Alexander was a telepath. Perhaps Alexander was merely leading him
      on. There were too many intangibles, and there was no way of predicting
      how it would turn out. But he felt mildly optimistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander closed the meeting, and Kennon left promptly. He had a good
      excuse. There was plenty of work to do if he was going to prepare an
      adequate plan for utilizing Olympus Station. Jordan went with him, but
      Blalok stayed behind. It was natural enough. Blalok was the administrator,
      but Kennon felt uneasy. Nor would he have felt any better if he could have
      heard what went on after he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander looked quizzically at Blalok after the door closed behind the
      two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Evald, what do you think? Does it strike you that Kennon's sincere&mdash;or
      does it sound as though he has something up his sleeve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he does," Blalok said, "I don't know what it could be. I wouldn't take
      a job on Olympus if you gave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he doesn't know about the place," Alexander said thoughtfully, "it's
      probable that his suggestion was honest. I think it is but I'm not sure.
      He worries me now that I can't read him. I think I'll send Douglas back
      here to watch him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? In my book that'd be a poor choice. After all, you said Kennon saved
      his life. He should be grateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know Douglas," Alexander said. "He hates Kennon's guts for what
      he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He made Douglas feel inferior. And there's no surer way to gain my
      cousin's undying enmity." Alexander laughed. "I know," he said. "He'd like
      to kill me, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in the meantime I want you to keep an eye on Kennon. If his outline
      is all right, I'm going to authorize him to set up this experiment. I want
      to give him every possible chance. I like him&mdash;and he's done good
      work. I wouldn't want him to feel that I distrust him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which you do, of course," Blalok said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander smiled. "Actually," he said with equal dryness, "I distrust
      everyone."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      "If you think this job is easy, you have another think coming," Kennon
      said bitterly. "I hired out as a veterinarian, not as a nursemaid for a
      bunch of psychoneurotic humans and superstitious Lani. The place is
      jinxed, they tell me.&mdash;Ha! Jinxed! Sure it's jinxed! What job
      wouldn't be with a bunch of goofballs like these I've got working on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't keep a Lani here for two weeks without having her throw a catfit,
      and the superstitious idiots are affecting the men&mdash;who ought to know
      better! I wish I'd never have opened my big mouth to Alexander! As far as
      I'm concerned he can take this job and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey&mdash;take it easy, man!" Blalok said. "You're heading straight for a
      nervous breakdown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why shouldn't I?" Kennon asked. "Nothing goes right. There's always
      trouble. I order materials&mdash;they don't arrive. There's worker
      trouble, equipment trouble, installation trouble. Everybody's cutting
      corners, trying to get done faster and away sooner&mdash;and all they do
      is mess up work that should have been done right the first time. We should
      have been finished last week, but we have another week to go, at least
      unless some bumble-fingered beanbrain gets another bright idea that sets
      us back again. I'm sick to death of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, I know," Blalok said soothingly, "and I'm sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry? What good is that? You and Jordan come up here in relays. Just
      what do you think you'll find? Or has Alexander dragged you into keeping
      an eye on me because I don't like someone snooping inside my skull?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not that," Blalok said. "It's just&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't make excuses. You know and I know the Boss-man is suspicious."
      Kennon shrugged. "Normally I wouldn't blame him but it's a damned nuisance
      with things the way they are. All we have is one more bay and a hall to
      finish&mdash;but if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now wait a minute," Blalok said. "Get the kink out of your neck and
      simmer down. Sure&mdash;the Boss-man told us to keep an eye on you&mdash;but
      that's not why I'm here this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Douglas came back this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know." Blalok's face wore the noncommittal look it always wore
      when he was taking liberties with the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're probably the worst liar in the galaxy," Kennon chuckled. "He's
      here to breathe down my neck, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep him off my back for another week and he can breathe all he wants to.
      I'll be done then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't promise a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. "It's too much to ask, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can try," Blalok added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's enough for me." Kennon grinned. "Has he turned Alexandria into a
      shambles yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, but everyone's uneasy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't blame them. That young fellow's undiluted poison. By the way, how
      does he look?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The medics must have done a good job," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Boss-man shipped him to Beta for treatment," Blalok said. "He didn't
      trust the docs out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That figures. At any rate Douglas couldn't have gone to a better place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He stuck his nose where he shouldn't," Kennon said pointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Evald. Even if you knew, I couldn't talk about it. What I know
      about Douglas is classified!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;Douglas is doing plenty of talking. Claims his stay in the
      hospital was all your fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. "That's his opinion. And as long as he stays out of my
      way he's welcome to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blalok looked at Kennon's haggard face with mild concern, "Doc," he said,
      "you'd better take it easy. You're going to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll be through here in another week, I'll have this all wrapped up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Providing you're not wrapped up first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a shroud. You look like a walking corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled wearily. "Sometimes I feel like one. But I'd like to get
      this job finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll do what I can," Blalok said. "I'll try to keep him down at
      Alexandria for a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It'll be enough," Kennon said. More than enough&mdash;he added mentally.
      The coils of fuel wire were ready to load, and the power slugs for the
      ship's reactor were already stored in the power plant building here at
      Olympus. Three more days and the old spacer would be as ready to fly as
      she would ever be. And after that, it was in the lap of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ushered Blalok to his jeep and watched until he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm getting to be a first-class liar," he remarked wryly to himself as he
      turned back to the temporary quarters he was occupying at the station.
      "And the bad thing about it is that I'm actually enjoying it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks ago an admission like that would have been inconceivable. It
      was odd, he thought, how one thing led to another and produced an end that
      could not be foreseen. Now he could lie and dissemble with the best. He
      had no compunction about falsifying a requisition, or stealing what he
      could not obtain with apparent honesty. His character had sunk to an
      all-time low, he reflected with grim humor as he walked into the shadow of
      the main building. Neither Blalok's nor Jordan's frequent visits bothered
      him. Both men were creatures of habit and both were married. They stayed
      home at night&mdash;and it was nighttime that he worked on the spacer. The
      project afforded him a perfect cover and it was only minutes by jeep away
      from the crater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so, the double duty was an appalling task. And it would have been
      impossible if it wasn't for Copper. Her quick fingers, keen eyesight, and
      uncanny memory made the work seem simple, and neither the tediousness of
      repairing miles of circuitry nor the depressing environment of Olympus
      Station seemed to bother her. While he worked with the men on the project
      she restored and reassembled circuits in his quarters and at night they
      replaced them in the old ship. And the God-Egg was rapidly becoming
      operational.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon wondered what it was about Copper that made her so different from
      the rest. Olympus didn't bother her at all. In fact she seemed to thrive
      on the depressing atmosphere that filled the Station. Perhaps it was
      because she had violated the tabu about the God-Egg so often that ordinary
      superstition had no effect upon her. He shrugged. He had troubles enough
      without worrying about Copper's motivations, and not the least of these
      was taking the God-Egg into space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked forward to blast-off with distinct misgivings. There was too
      much about the ancient spacer that was strange&mdash;and too much that was
      terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically the ship was an ion-jet job with atomic primaries and a
      spindizzy converter that might possibly take her up as high as middle
      yellow Cth&mdash;far enough to give her a good turn of speed, but not
      enough to compensate for timelag. Her screens were monstrosities, double
      polyphase lattices that looked about as spacetight as so many sieves.
      There were no acceleration dampers, no temporal compensators, no
      autopilot, no four-space computer, and the primaries operated on nuclear
      rather than binding energy. The control chairs weren't equipped with
      forcefields, but instead had incredibly primitive safety webs that held
      one in place by sheer tensile strength. Taking a ship like that into space
      was an open invitation to suicide. A man needed a combination of foolhardy
      bravery and incredible fatalism to blast off in a can like this. He had
      the stimulus, but the knowledge of what he would face troubled him more
      than he cared to admit. More and more, as he understood the ship, he was
      amazed at the courage of the ancients who had blithely leaped into
      hyperspace in these flying coffins with no more motivation than to see
      what was beyond the nearest star. And in ships more primitive than this
      men had swept through the star systems nearest Earth in the outward
      expansion of the First Millennium.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. The breed of man must have been tough in the old days&mdash;and
      he'd soon be finding out if any of that ancient toughness remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door to his quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper was sitting in his favorite chair, a pile of completed assemblies
      neatly stacked beside her, and a disorderly file of crumpled cloth at her
      feet. Her face was sullen as she looked up at him. "I've had about all of
      this I'm going to take," she said mutinously as she stirred the heap of
      cloth with a bare foot. "Not even you are going to make me wear those&mdash;things!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sighed. It was the same old story. For months he had been trying
      patiently to indoctrinate Copper with a minimum of civilized habits, but
      she was quite literally a savage. In her entire lifetime she had never
      worn clothing, and to encase her body in hose, kilts, blouse, and sandals
      was a form of torture. She scratched, wiggled, and twisted at the garments
      until she looked as bad as she felt, and would usually finish a session by
      tearing off the offending clothes and sulking. She was doing it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must act like a civilized human being," Kennon said mildly. "You're
      simply going to have to learn to wear these clothes properly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? I'm more comfortable as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not the point. You are going to be living in human society and you
      must act human. The only planet where you could get away with nudity is
      Santos, and we're not going there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've explained it time and again. We'll have to go to Beta. That's the
      only place I know where you'll have a fair hearing. And on Beta people
      wear clothes. They have to. It's cold, even in summer, and in the
      wintertime, there's snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's snow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ice crystals that fall like rain, but I've told you this before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I still don't believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe it or not you're going to wear those things. Now put them on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with mutiny on her face. "All right, slave driver," she
      muttered as she picked up the clothing, "but I hope you'll itch someday
      and be unable to scratch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And try to wear those garments more gracefully. You make them look like a
      sack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They feel like one. I keep thinking that all I need is a tag around my
      neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't much time to get used to them," Kennon said. "We're leaving
      this week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;and you'll wear those things to the ship, into the ship, and
      all the time we're on the ship. You'll keep wearing clothing until it
      looks right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slave driver!" Copper hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slave," Kennon answered equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper giggled. The sound was utterly unexpected, and completely
      incongruous. That was the wonder of her, Kennon reflected. Her mercurial
      temperament made life something that was continually exciting She was a
      never-ending delight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the last trip. Kennon loaded the jeep with the last-minute items he
      would need. The four reactor cores in their lead cases went aboard last
      and were packed inside a pile of lead-block shielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped Copper in and looked back without regret as the bulk of Olympus
      Station vanished below him in the dusk. The last of the work crew had left
      that afternoon. The station was ready for occupancy. His assignment had
      been completed. He felt an odd pleasure at having finished the job.
      Alexander might not be happy about his subsequent actions, but he could
      have no complaint about what he did while he was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;say good-bye to Flora," he said to Copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to," she said. "I don't want to leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't stay. You know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "But that doesn't make me any less regretful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Regretful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;scared. We're going to try to make the God-Egg fly again.
      Not only is it sacrilege, but as you've often said, it's dangerous. I have
      no desire to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have two courses&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&mdash;you've pointed them out often enough," Copper said. "And
      since you decided to go I'd go with you even though I knew the Egg would
      blow up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're quite a girl," Kennon said admiringly. "Did I ever tell you that I
      love you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not nearly often enough," Copper said. "You could do it every day and I'd
      never get tired of hearing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The jeep settled over the lava wall. "We'll leave it in the passageway
      when we're through," Kennon said. "Maybe it will survive blast-off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why worry about it?" Copper asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate destroying anything needlessly," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And since we have plenty of time, we might as well be neat about our
      departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wrong, of course, but he didn't know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas Alexander checked the radarscope and whistled in surprise at the
      picture it revealed. "So that's where he's going," he said softly to
      himself. "Cousin Alex was right as usual." He grimaced unpleasantly. "He's
      up to something&mdash;that's for sure." His face twisted into an
      expression that was half sneer, half triumph. "This is going to be fun."
      He moved the control, and his airboat, hovering silently at five thousand
      meters, dropped toward the ground in free fall as Douglas loosened the
      Burkholtz in the holster at his waist. "But what is he doing?" he
      muttered. The question hung unanswered in the still air of the cabin as
      the airboat dropped downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas hadn't been impressed with Blalok's attempt at a delaying action.
      Normally he might have been, but his fear of his cousin was greater than
      his respect for Blalok. The superintendent had only succeeded in
      accomplishing something he had not intended when he had tried to dissuade
      Douglas from visiting Kennon. He had made Douglas cautious. The airboat
      and long-range surveillance had been the result. For the past two nights
      Douglas had hung over Olympus Station, checking the place&mdash;to leave
      at dawn when the new day's work began. For two nights Kennon had been
      lucky. He had departed for the Egg shortly before Douglas took up his
      station, and had returned after the watcher had called it a night and had
      returned home. But this last night, Kennon left late&mdash;and his
      departure was noted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonder who's the girl with him?" Douglas said as the boat plunged down.
      "Well, I'll be finding out in a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon's head jerked upward at the sound of air whistling past the
      airboat's hull, and a wave of icy coldness swept through his chest. There
      was no question that he was discovered. His shoulders sagged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;it was a good try," he said bitterly as Copper looked at him
      with sudden terror on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to die," she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't&mdash;not if I can help it," Kennon said. "Move away from me&mdash;quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as I say!" Kennon's voice was sharp. "And keep that hood over your
      face."
    </p>
    <p>
      The airboat settled softly on the ash in front of him, the door snapped
      open and Douglas dropped to the ground, Burkholtz jutting from his pudgy
      fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My, my," Douglas said, "what have we here? Dr. Kennon and a woman! I
      thought better of you than that, Doctor. And all dressed up in
      antiradiation suits. This is interesting. Just what are you doing up here
      on the mountain so late at night&mdash;prospecting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might call it that," Kennon said. His body sagged with relief.
      Douglas thank Ochsner it was Douglas! He was running true to form&mdash;talking
      when he should have been shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas jerked his head toward Copper, standing a few feet to his left.
      "Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of your business," Kennon snapped, hoping that his outburst covered
      Copper's gasp of surprise and fear, and knowing that it didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm making it my business. There's something funny going on around here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon blinked. Could it be that Douglas didn't know? Had he been watching
      them on radar? Durilium was radar-transparent. It absorbed and dissipated
      electromagnetic waves rather than reflecting them. For a second he felt a
      tiny surge of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand where you are," Douglas said as he stepped over to the
      half-paralyzed Copper and jerked the hood back from her face. For a moment
      he looked puzzled. "Just who are you?" he demanded. "I don't recall seeing
      you before." And then recognition dawned. "Old Doc's Lani!" he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She works for me now," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas laughed. It wasn't a nice sound. "All dressed up?" he asked. "Nice
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my fault," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the rules," Douglas said. "I could blast you both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go ahead," Kennon said, "but if you do, you'll never find out what we're
      doing up here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas hesitated. Kennon's voice was flat and filled with utter
      conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a reason why Copper's wearing that suit," Kennon continued, "and
      you won't know that either."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Burkholtz swiveled around to point at Kennon's belly. "I've had about
      enough of this. Let's have it. Tell me what you're doing here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do better than that," Kennon said promptly. "I'll show you. You'll
      be surprised at what we've uncovered." He made his muscles relax, and
      forced himself to speak naturally. Copper, he noted, was still rigid with
      terror. The Alexanders&mdash;any of them&mdash;were everything he had said
      they were. They were the masters here. And despite Copper's boast, she was
      as susceptible to their influence as any other Lani.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," Douglas said, "show me this thing I'd never be able to find
      without your help." He half turned to Copper. "Stay where you are, Lani,"
      he said. "Don't move until I come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Man Douglas," Copper replied. Her voice was flat, colorless, and
      submissive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shuddered. He had never heard precisely that tone from her before.
      One word from Douglas and she had become a zombie&mdash;a mindless muscle
      preparation that existed only to obey. Anger filled him&mdash;anger that
      one he loved could be ordered by someone who wasn't worth a third of her&mdash;anger
      that she obeyed&mdash;anger at his own impotence and frustration. It
      wasn't a clean anger. It was a dark, red-splashed thing that struggled and
      writhed inside him, a fierce unreasoning rage that seethed and bubbled yet
      could not break free. For an instant, with blinding clarity, Kennon
      understood the feelings of the caged male Lani on Otpen One. And he
      sympathized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow me," he said and started around the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay&mdash;no&mdash;go ahead," Douglas said, "but remember, I'm right
      behind you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon walked straight up to the pit and pointed down at the dark bulk of
      the Egg., concealed in the shadows of the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? I don't see anything," Douglas said suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here&mdash;I'll shine a light." Kennon reached for his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No you don't! I know that trick. You're not going to blind me. Take that
      torch loose carefully&mdash;that's it&mdash;now hand it to me." Douglas'
      hand closed over the smooth plastic. Cautiously he turned on the beam and
      directed it downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A spacer!" he gasped. "How did that get here?" He leaned forward to look
      into the pit as a dark shadow materialized behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon choked back the involuntary cry of warning that rose in his throat.
      Copper! His muscles tensed as her arm came up and down&mdash;a shadow
      almost invisible in the starlight. The leaning figure of Douglas collapsed
      like a puppet whose strings had been suddenly released. The torch dropped
      from his hand and went bouncing and winking down the wall of the pit,
      followed by Douglas&mdash;a limp bundle of arms and legs that rotated
      grotesquely as he disappeared down the slope. Starlight gleamed on the
      Burkholtz lying on the lip of the crater, where it had fallen from his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you that not even Man Alexander could order me since I gave my
      love to you," Copper said smugly as she peered over the edge of the pit, a
      chunk of lava gripped in one small capable hand. "Maybe this proves it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Douglas isn't Alexander," Kennon said slowly as he picked up the blaster,
      "but I believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't I act convincingly?" she said brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," he said. "You fooled me completely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The important thing was that I fooled Douglas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did that all right. Now let's get him out of that pit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The jet blast will fry him when we take off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What difference would that make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you," Kennon said, "that I never destroy things unnecessarily&mdash;not
      even things like Douglas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he would have destroyed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's no excuse for murder. Now go back to the jeep and fetch a rope.
      I'll go down and get him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do we have to bother with him?" Copper asked, and then shrugged. It was
      an eloquent gesture expressing disgust, resignation, and unwilling
      compliance in one lift of smoothly muscled shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no question about it," Kennon said. "You're becoming more human
      every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled as he slid over the edge of the pit following the path Douglas
      had taken a moment before. He found him sitting on a pile of ashes,
      shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What happened?" Douglas asked querulously. There was fear in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Copper hit you on the head with a rock," Kennon said as he bent over and
      retrieved the torch, still burning near Douglas' feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Lani?" Douglas' voice was incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a Lani," Kennon corrected. "She's as human as you or I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a lie," Douglas said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe this spacer's a lie too. Her ancestors came in it&mdash;a pair of
      humans named Alfred and Melissa Weygand. They were Christian missionaries
      from a planet called Heaven out in Ophiuchus Sector. Went out to convert
      aliens and landed here when their fuel ran out." Kennon paused. "That was
      about four millennia ago. Their descendants, naturally, reverted to
      barbarism in a few generations, but there's enough evidence in the ship to
      prove that the Lani were their children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the tails&mdash;the differences&mdash;the failure of the test,"
      Douglas said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mutation," Kennon replied. "Those old spindizzy converters weren't too
      choosy about how they scattered radiation. And they had come a long way."
      He paused, looking down at Douglas, feeling a twinge of pity for the man.
      His world was crumbling. "And there was no other human blood available to
      filter out their peculiarities. It might have been done during the first
      couple of generations, but constant inbreeding fixed the genetic pattern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you discover this?" Douglas asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accident," Kennon said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll never be able to prove they're human!" Douglas said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ship's log will do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not without a humanity test&mdash;they can't pass that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry to disappoint you. Your grandfather used the wrong sort of sperm.
      Now if there had been a Betan in the crew&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean she's pregnant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. "There's been mutation on Beta," he said. "And it's
      apparently a similar one to hers. Betan-Lani matings are fertile."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas's shoulders sagged, and then straightened. "I don't believe it,"
      he said. "You're just a damned sneaking spy. Somehow or other you got a
      spacer in here after you wormed your way into Cousin Alex's confidence&mdash;and
      now you're going to space out with the nucleus of a new farm. Just wait.
      When Alex learns of this the galaxy'll be too small to hold you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't babble like a fool!" Kennon said with disgust. "How could I land a
      spacer here without being spotted? You sound like a two-credit novel. And
      even if I did&mdash;would it be a can like this?" Kennon played the torch
      over the blue-black durilium protruding from the ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas' eyes widened as he took in the details of construction. "What an
      antique!" he blurted. "Where did you get this can?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found it here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me another one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't believe," Kennon said flatly, "because you don't dare believe.
      You have a mental block. You've killed, maimed, tortured&mdash; treated
      them like animals&mdash;and now your mind shrinks from admitting they're
      human. You know what will happen if the old court decision is reversed. It
      will wreck your little empire, dry up your money, break you&mdash;and you
      can't stand the thought of that. You don't dare let us leave, yet you
      can't stop us because I have your blaster and I'd just as soon shoot you
      as look at your rotten face. Now get on your feet and start climbing if
      you want to stay alive. We're getting out of here, and you'll fry inside
      this pit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you taking me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back to your airboat. I'm going to tie you up and set you off on
      autopilot. You'll be able to get loose quickly enough but it'll be too
      late to stop us. We'll be gone, and you can think of how you'll manage to
      face the human race."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you blow yourself and that antique clear out of space."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might. But you'll never know for sure. But mark this&mdash;if I live
      I'll be back with the Brotherhood. You can count on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They struggled up the side of the pit and halted, panting, on the rim.
      "How much radiation was down there?" Douglas asked worriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not enough to hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good." Douglas accepted the statement at face value, a fact which
      failed to surprise Kennon. "You know," he said, "I've been around Lani all
      my life. And I know that they're not human. No self-respecting human would
      take a tenth of what they put up with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their ancestors didn't," Kennon said. "They fought to the end. But your
      Grandfather was a smart man even though he was a Degrader."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wasn't!" Douglas exploded. "No Alexander is a Degrader."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He realized," Kennon went on, "that he'd never succeed in enslaving the
      Lani unless he separated the sexes. And since women are more subjective in
      their outlook&mdash;and more pliable&mdash;he picked them for his slaves.
      The males he retired to stud. Probably the fact that there were more women
      than men helped him make up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In every society," Kennon went on inexorably, "there are potential
      freeman and potential slaves. The latter invariably outnumber the former.
      They're cowards: the timid, the unsacrificing&mdash;the ones that want
      peace at any price&mdash;the ones who will trade freedom for security.
      Those were the ones who hid rather than risk their lives fighting the
      aggressor. Those were the ones who survived. Old Alexander had a
      ready-made slave cadre when he finished off the last of the warriors. For
      four centuries the survivors have been bred and selected to perpetuate
      slave traits. And the system works. The men don't want freedom&mdash;they
      want liberty to kill each other. The women don't want freedom&mdash;they
      want males. And they'd serve them precisely as the Sarkian women serve
      their menfolk. You've killed any chance they had to become a civilization.
      It's going to take generations perhaps before they're reoriented. There's
      plenty you Alexanders should answer for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there's any fault, it's yours," Douglas snarled. "We were doing all
      right until you came here. We'd still be doing all right if I had shot you
      both." His shoulders sagged. "I should have killed you when I had the
      chance," he said bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you didn't," Kennon said, "and to show my gratitude I'm letting you
      get away with a whole skin. I don't expect you to be grateful, but at
      least you'll not be on my conscience. I don't enjoy killing, not even
      things like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas sneered. "You're soft&mdash;a soft sentimental fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admitted," Kennon said, "but that's my nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you'd destroy the family, wreck Outworld Enterprises, and throw a
      whole world into chaos over a few thousand animals. I don't understand
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're human," Kennon said flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admitting they might once have been, they're not now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whose fault is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not ours," Douglas said promptly. "If there is any fault it's that of the
      court who decided they were humanoid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't help any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should we? Does one treat a shrake like a brother?&mdash;or a varl?&mdash;or
      a dog? We treat them like the animals they are. And we've done no worse
      with the Lani. Our consciences are clear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon laughed humorlessly. "Yet this clear conscience makes you want to
      kill me, so you can keep on treating them as animals&mdash;even though you
      know they're human."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing of the sort. But you're right about the killing, I'd kill
      you cheerfully if I had the chance. It's our necks if you get away with
      this. Of course, you probably won't, but why take the chance. I like my
      neck more than I like yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're honest at any rate," Kennon admitted. "And in a way I don't blame
      you. To you it's probably better to be a rich slaver living off the legacy
      of a Degrader than a penniless humanitarian. But you've lost your chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas screamed with rage. He whirled on Kennon, his face a distorted
      mask of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold it!" Kennon barked. "I don't want to kill you, but I'll burn a hole
      clear through your rotten carcass if you make another move. I have no love
      for your kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas spat contemptuously. "You haven't got the guts," he snarled. But
      he didn't move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just stand still&mdash;very still," Kennon said softly. The iron in his
      voice was not hidden by the quiet tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Douglas shivered. "I'll get you yet," he said, but there was no force in
      the threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the rope you wanted," Copper said as she emerged abruptly from the
      darkness. "I had a hard time finding it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't been too long," Kennon said. "Now tie Douglas' hands behind
      him while I keep him covered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a pleasure," Copper murmured.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I'm frightened," Copper said, twisting uncomfortably in the shock chair
      beside Kennon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After you have been so brave?" Kennon asked. "That's nonsense. It's just
      nervous reaction. Now web in like I showed you. It's time for blast-off.
      We don't dare wait much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;but I have a feeling that this isn't right. Something is
      going to go wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you don't have precognition." Kennon smiled. "I've checked
      everything. The ship is as good as she'll ever be. There's nothing more
      that we can do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's one consolation," Copper said wanly. "At we'll die together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a better chance that we'll live together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flipped the switches that would send the fuel rods into the reactor.
      Below them a soft, barely audible whine ascended the sonic scale to a
      point of irritating inaudibility. Kennon smiled. The spindizzy was
      functioning properly. He flipped a second bank of switches and a dull roar
      came from the buried stem. Ashes and pumice heated to incandescence were
      blown through the air. Molten drops of radioactive lava skittered across
      the durilium hull as Kennon advanced the power. The whole stem of the ship
      was immersed in a seething lake of bolling rock as the Egg lifted slowly
      with ponderous dignity into the night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang on!" Kennon said. "I'm going to hyper." His hand moved a red lever
      and the Egg shimmered and vanished with a peculiar wrenching motion into
      an impossible direction that the mind could not grasp. And the interceptor
      missile from Otpen One nosed through the space the Egg had occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      "We made it!" Kennon said, looking across the writhing semifluid control
      board, shifting oddly in the harsh yellow monochromatic light that
      pervaded the cabin. The screens were leaking like sieves, but they were
      holding well enough to keep Cth yellow from being anything more than an
      annoyance. He glanced over at Copper, a fantastically elongated Copper who
      looked like a madman's dream of chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Copper screamed! The sound echoed and re-echoed, dying away with a
      lingering discordant reverberation that made his skin tingle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Copper! It's all right! It's all fight! Stop it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper screamed again and her elongated figure suddenly foreshortened and
      collapsed into a small writhing ball from which two small pink hands
      emerged clutching at a gelid mass of air that flowed sluggishly around
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kennon knew what he had forgotten! Hyperspace with leaky screens was
      nothing to inflict upon an unprepared mind. It is one thing to endure
      partial exposure after months of training, with experienced medics
      standing by to help you through the shock phase, but quite another to be
      thrust from a safe and sheltered existence into the mind shattering
      distortions of the Cth continuum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egg was old. Her screens, never good at best, were hardly more than
      filters. Through the hull, through the drive lattice, the viciously
      distorted Cth environment seeped into the ship turning prosaic shapes of
      controls and instruments into writhing masses of obscene horror that sent
      extensions wiggling off into nothingness at eye-aching angles. A spaceman
      could take this&mdash;knowing it wasn't real&mdash;but a tyro could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper collapsed. Her mind, assaulted by sensations no untrained person
      should experience, went into shock. But she wasn't granted the mercy of
      unconsciousness. Terrified by a pseudo reality that surpassed her wildest
      nightmares, she stared wide-eyed at the control room and the thing that
      had been Kennon. She screamed until her throat was raw, until the monster
      beside her touched her with Kennon's hands. Then, mercifully, she felt a
      stinging in her arm and all sensation ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon stared glumly at the controls. Fleming alone knew how many
      objective years were passing outside as they hurtled through four-space.
      Subjectively it would only be hours aboard the Egg, but a decade&mdash;or
      maybe a century&mdash;might pass outside this mad universe where neither
      time nor speed had meaning. The old ships didn't have temporal
      compensators, nor could they travel through upper bands of Cth where
      subjective and objective time were more nearly equal. They were trapped in
      a semi-stasis of time as the ship fled on through the distorted
      monochromatic regions that bypassed normal space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egg slipped smoothly out of the hyper jump, back into the normal
      universe. Beta floated above them, the blue shield of her atmosphere
      shining softly in the light of Beta's sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't hit it that good again in a hundred tries," Kennon gloated.
      "Halfway across the galaxy&mdash;and right on the nose." He looked at the
      shock chair beside him. Copper was curled into a tight ball inside the
      confining safety web, knees drawn up, back bent, head down&mdash;arms
      wrapped protectingly around her legs&mdash;the fetal position of catatonic
      shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook her shoulder&mdash;no response. Her pulse was thready and
      irregular. Her breathing was shallow. Her lips were blue. Her condition
      was obvious&mdash;space shock&mdash;extreme grade. She'd need medical
      attention if she was going to live. And she'd need it fast!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just why, you educated nitwit," he snarled at himself, "didn't you have
      sense enough to give her that injection of Sonmol before we hypered! You
      haven't the sense of a decerebrate Capellan grackle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on the radio. "Emergency!" he said. "Any station! Space-shock
      case aboard. Extreme urgency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Identify yourself&mdash;give your license. Over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What port are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hunterstown&mdash;will you please identify? Over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your co-ordinates," Kennon snapped. "Over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "280.45&mdash;67.29 plus. Repeat&mdash;request your identification."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pilot Kennon, Jac, Beta 47M 26429. I have no I.D. for the ship&mdash;and
      you'll see why when I land. Over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hunterstown Port to Kennon. You are not&mdash;repeat not&mdash;cleared to
      land. Go into orbit and report your position. Over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Hunterstown. You wouldn't have checked in if you didn't have room,
      and a hospital. This is an emergency. I'm setting down. Out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;" The words got no farther. Kennon was already spinning the
      ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;we have you on the scope. But this is a class one
      violation. You may come in on Landing Beam One."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. I have no GCA."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?&mdash;what sort of ship are you flying?" The voice was curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm matching intrinsics over your port. Talk me in when I break through
      the overcast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talk you in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right. My instruments are obsolete."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Halstead! What else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an Ion drive. Plus two radioactive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no!&mdash;And you still want to come in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to. My passenger's in shock. She's going to have a baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right&mdash;I'll try to get you down in one piece."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have an ambulance ready," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon lowered the Egg through the overcast. Ground control picked him up
      smoothly and took him down as though it had been rehearsed. The Egg
      touched down in the radioactive area of the port. Decontamination jets
      hissed, sluicing the ship to remove surface contamination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ochsner! what sort of a ship is that?" Ground Control's startled voice
      came over the annunciator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's an old one," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a gross understatement. Stand by for boarders. Ambulance coming
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon opened the airlock and two radiation-suited men entered. "At least
      you had sense enough to wear protective clothing in this hotbox," one said
      as they carefully unwebbed Copper and carried her out of the lock. "You
      wait here. The Port Captain wants to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you taking her? What Center?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should you care? You've nearly killed her. The idea of taking a
      pregnant woman up in this death trap! What in Fleming's name's the matter
      with your brain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to," Kennon said. "I had to. It was a matter of life and death."
      For once, he thought wryly, the cliche was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Betan's face behind the transparent helmet was disgusted and
      unbelieving. "I hear that sort of thing every day," he said. "Am I
      supposed to believe it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd believe it if you'd have been where I was," Kennon muttered. "Now&mdash;whe're
      are you taking her?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man arched blond eyebrows. "To the local Medical Center&mdash;where
      else? There's only one in this area."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the ambulance flit off as he waited for the Spaceport Patrol.
      There was no further need for the protection suit, so he peeled it off and
      hung it in the control-room locker. Copper was right, he mused. It did
      itch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Port Captain's men were late as usual&mdash;moving gingerly through
      the radiation area. A noncom gestured for him to enter their carryall.
      "Port Captain wants to see you," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," Kennon replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have waited upstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't. It was a matter of medicine," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noncom's face sobered. "Why didn't you say so? All you said was that
      it was an emergency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been away. I forgot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't have done that. You're a Betan, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove to the Port Office, where Kennon expected&mdash;and got&mdash;a
      bad time from the port officials. He filled out numerous forms, signed
      affidavits, explained his unauthorized landing, showed his spaceman's
      ticket, defended his act of piloting without an up-to-date license, signed
      more forms, entered a claim for salvage rights to the Egg, and finally
      when the Legal Division, the Traffic Control Division, the Spaceport
      Safety Office, Customs, Immigration, and Travelers Aid had finished with
      him, he was ushered into the presence of the Port Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-faced chunky officer eyed him with a cold stare. "You'll be lucky,
      young man, if you get out of this with a year in Correction. Your story
      doesn't hang together."
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't, Kennon thought. But there was no sense telling all of it to a
      Port Captain. Under no circumstances could the man be any help to him. He
      had neither the power nor the prestige to request a Brotherhood Board of
      Inquiry. In rank, he was hardly more than a glorified Traffic Control
      officer. It would do no good to tell him an improbable tale of slavery on
      a distant planet. The only thing to do was wait out the storm and hope it
      would pass. If worst came to worst he'd use his rank, but he'd made enough
      stir already. He doubted if the Captain had authority to order him into
      Detention&mdash;but he was certain to get a lecture. These minor officials
      loved to tell someone off. He gritted his teeth. He'd endure it for
      Copper's sake&mdash;and to get out of here quietly. Alexander would
      undoubtedly have agents posted by now, and his only chance for temporary
      freedom of action was to get out of here with as little fuss as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat quietly, his flushed face and tight jaw muscles betraying his
      impatience as the Captain paced up and down and talked on and on. The man
      sounded like he could go for hours. With increasing impatience Kennon
      listened to the cadenced flow of complaint and condemnation, occasionally
      inserting a "Yes, sir" or "Sorry, sir" or "No, sir" as the words flowed
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there had to be a breaking point somewhere, and the monotony was
      beginning to wear his temper thin. Another five minutes, he reflected, was
      about all he could take.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door chime rang softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in," the Port Captain said, breaking off in mid-tirade. The change
      in his manner was so abrupt that Kennon couldn't help smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young blond man in an interne's gray uniform entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Doctor," the Port Captain said. "What can I do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you have a Jac Kennon here? Dr. Jac Kennon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you say doctor?" the Port Captain said in a half-strangled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never let me tell you," Kennon said mildly, "that my landing here was
      a matter of medicine. Technically you have contributed to a delay in
      treatment."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Port Captain's face paled. "Why didn't you say something?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Against your gale of wind I would be but a faint breeze," Kennon said
      coldly. He turned to the interne. "I'm Dr. Kennon." They bowed formally to
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Smalley, sir, from the medical center. Dr. Brainard sends his
      compliments and requests that you join him for consultation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Port Captain&mdash;" Kennon began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about it, Doctor. I'll relinquish responsibility to Dr.
      Brainard," the Captain said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have placed a formal written request with your office," Smalley said
      stiffly. "You are relieved of further charge. Dr. Kennon is urgently
      needed. It is a matter of medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked relieved. On Beta it was poor policy to interfere with
      the doings of doctors and engineers&mdash;or even doctors of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. He's yours&mdash;and I'm glad to be rid of him." The Port
      Captain bowed to Kennon and Smalley and stalked out of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pompous little man," Kennon observed, "but he certainly can talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;you know these Administrative people," the interne said
      depreciatingly. "One mustn't mind them. They're necessary nuisances." He
      eyed Kennon curiously. "How is it that you didn't stand on your
      professional rights?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have my reasons&mdash;but they have nothing to do with medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;I see. Ethical." The interne's voice was faintly sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manners, Doctor&mdash;manners." Kennon's voice was gentle but the interne
      flushed a dull red.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mention it. It's normal for a graduate to confuse liberty with
      license." Kennon smiled. "Don't worry. I shan't report you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's good of you, sir." Smalley's face registered relief. Demerits were
      difficult to erase&mdash;particularly ones of courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon wondered if the young man would report himself. He doubted it. The
      interne didn't look the type&mdash;probably he was dated for some obscure
      job, like a general practitioner. He shrugged. It took all kinds to make a
      profession. Even the Smalleys had their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That girl you brought in," Smalley said as they entered a white car
      emblazoned with the three crosses, red, blue, and green, that represented
      the three fields of medicine. "She's an interesting case. I've never seen
      space shock before. And the patient herself&mdash;one would hardly believe
      she was a Betan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She isn't," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?" Blond eyebrows rose in inverted U's of surprise. "But that's hardly
      possible. Our tests indicate-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think that this is a matter for Dr. Brainard?" Kennon said
      icily. "Protocol&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Stupid of me&mdash;but the case is so interesting. Half the
      center staff have seen her already. I wasn't proposing to discuss the
      case. It wouldn't be proper. Even though you are only a veterinarian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only?" Kennon's voice was hard. "I shouldn't have to remind you of this,
      Mr. Smalley&mdash;but I have been for the past two years on a world of bad
      manners. I expected better here at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smalley flushed to the roots of his straw-colored hair. "Sorry, Doctor,"
      he muttered. "I don't know what's the matter with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you," Kennon said. "You've just graduated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you know?" Smalley said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a graduate once, myself&mdash;not too long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Class of Eighty-seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's twelve years ago," Smalley said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. Ten years lost. Not bad&mdash;not bad at all. But Alexander
      could have done a lot in ten years.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant no disrespect," Smalley said worriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it. But if you intend to practice on Beta, you'd better polish
      your professional manner. Now where I was, it didn't make much difference.
      Laymen often called me 'Doc.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smalley was properly shocked. "I hope you didn't encourage them, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was impossible to discourage them," Kennon said. "After all, when the
      man who hires you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;entrepreneurs," Smalley said in a tone that explained
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      The car stopped in front of the Medical Center's staff entrance. "This
      way, sir," Smalley said. He led the way down a green-tiled corridor to an
      elevator&mdash;then down another corridor past a pair of soft-footed
      nurses who eyed them curiously&mdash;looking at Kennon's tunic and sandals
      with mild disapproval in their eyes. Smalley stopped and knocked softly on
      a closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enter," said a pleasant baritone voice from the annunciator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Brainard&mdash;Dr. Kennon," Smalley said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon liked the man instantly. A plump, pink-cheeked man of middle age,
      with prematurely white hair, Dr. Will Brainard combined a fatherly
      appearance with an impression of quick intelligence. The fat that sheathed
      his stocky body had obviously not touched his mind. Brainard rose from the
      deep chair near the window where he had been sitting, knocked the ashes
      from his pipe, and bowed stiffly. His eyes&mdash;sharp points of blue in
      the smooth pinkness of his face&mdash;surveyed Kennon curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're the young man who takes untrained pregnant women for rides in
      old-fashioned spacers," he said. "Didn't you know what would happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was in a hurry, Doctor," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obviously. Now tell me about it." Brainard looked at the eager-faced
      interne standing behind Kennon. "That will be all, Smalley," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon waited until the door closed. "Ordinarily," he said, "I'd never
      have done a thing like that, but there were some very pressing reasons.
      However, I should have given her an injection of Somnol before we started.
      I'm criminally liable. If anything happens to her&mdash;" His voice was
      tight with worry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd give her an injection?" Brainard said. "I hope you didn't mean
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I did, sir. I've given thousands of Lani injections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's a Lani?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is, sir. The impression has been that her race isn't human."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense&mdash;it's obvious she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Brotherhood Court of Inquiry didn't think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hmm. Is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir.&mdash;But before I go on, tell me, how is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she'll be fine. A little mental therapy and plenty of rest are all
      she needs. She's a remarkably healthy young woman. But this is beside the
      point. There are a number of unusual features about this case that need
      investigation." Brainard took a standard hospital form from his desk.
      "Mind if I ask you some questions, Doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all but you are due for some unpleasant shocks as you go through
      that form."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I can survive them," Brainard said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is professional confidence&mdash;" Kennon began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course," Brainard said impatiently. "Now let's get on with
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the most amazing tale I've ever heard," Brainard said slowly.
      "Are you certain you are telling the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon grinned. "I don't blame you for not believing me&mdash;but the
      evidence is conclusive, and there is enough documentary evidence in the
      space ship&mdash;and in the fact of the ship itself to prove what I am
      saying. Laboratory tests here will establish the fact that Copper's child
      is also mine. And as for Flora, a Brotherhood Investigation Team can prove
      that part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be attended to," Brainard said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how did you deduce she wasn't from a Betan colony?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brainard smiled. "That wasn't hard. Her sun tan and the condition of her
      feet proved she was a practicing nudist. No Betan girl ever practices
      nudism to my knowledge. Besides, the I.D. tattoo under her left arm and
      the V on her hip are no marks of our culture. Then there was another thing&mdash;the
      serological analysis revealed no gerontal antibodies. She had never
      received an injection of longevity compound in her life. This might occur,
      but it's highly improbable. The evidence indicates that she's
      extra-Betan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this business of her being fifteen years old! That's impossible. She
      has the development of a woman of twenty-five."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember the Alpha V colony?" Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course&mdash;oh&mdash;I see! It could be something like that.
      Certainly&mdash;strong yellow G-type sun&mdash;an isolated colony serviced
      at twenty-year intervals&mdash;there was a marked physical precocity."
    </p>
    <h3>
      "And if this had been continued for several millennia?" Kennon asked.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Hmm&mdash;I see. Yes, it's possible. On Alpha V the colonists grew from
      infancy to maturity in fifteen years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And wasn't Heaven one of our early colonies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;it was established after the Great Schism near the end of the
      First Millennium&mdash;when science and religion split irrevocably on this
      world. We packed the whole lot of them off to a world of their own where
      they could develop as they pleased. They called it Heaven&mdash;odd name
      for a fogworld&mdash;but there's no accounting for tastes." Brainard
      chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought that was the case, but I couldn't remember. My ancient history
      is pretty weak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should read more," Brainard said. "But as I see it&mdash;this girl is
      of Betan ancestry providing your theory and the facts coincide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which could also explain why an outworld species of agerone would be
      toxic. They tried to prolong Lani life and met with failure. Our plants
      are mutant forms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as we are a mutant race," Brainard said, "or partly mutant." He
      sighed. "You have brought us a great deal of trouble, Kennon. You are
      bringing matters to a head. If our investigations prove your statements,
      we are morally bound to open the Lani question. And if those people are of
      Betan origin&mdash;that fellow Alexander will have plenty to answer for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it is really his fault," Kennon said slowly. "I don't
      think he has ever known the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you tell him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The answer to that should be obvious. Even though I trusted him
      completely, I could never be sure. He has a Free Trader background and
      those people can't he trusted where money's concerned. The whole Kardonian
      culture is an outgrowth of Free Traderism: small business, independent
      corporation, linear trusts, and all the cutthroat competition such a
      culture would naturally have. It's a regular jungle of Free Enterprise. I
      couldn't predict how he would react. He could either act in a moral manner
      and make restitution, or he could quietly cut our throats and go on with
      his business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. The temptation to cut a throat might be overwhelming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They fight commercial wars," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disgusting&mdash;utterly uncivilized! Under the circumstances you had no
      other course. Still, they have no moral right to enslave human beings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is always the element of doubt. Maybe they didn't know. After all,
      an impartial court declared the Lani alien&mdash;and the Betan mutation
      isn't known throughout the Brotherhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One doesn't go around broadcasting data on the variations of one's germ
      plasm," Brainard said. "That's a private affair&mdash;a matter of personal
      privacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And public safety?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brainard nodded. "We're no more courageous than any other civilization. We
      have no desire to borrow trouble. We are content to leave things alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the trouble," Kennon said. "We're all content to leave things
      alone. If I hadn't found the spaceship I'd not have been able to lay aside
      my moral conditioning. And if I had not, Copper would not have become
      pregnant and forced me into these drastic actions. It's even possible that
      I would have done nothing." He grimaced. "And when I left Alexander's
      employment mnemonic erasure would have removed all memory of the Lani's
      human origin." He shrugged. "I still am not certain that it wouldn't have
      been the wiser course. Naturally, once I knew, I couldn't do anything else
      than what I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally," Brainard said. "Humanity reaches the heights when it faces
      questions of moral responsibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To mankind," Kennon added heavily. "We have a convenient blind spot
      regarding our moral responsibility to other intelligent races."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A harsh fact, but true&mdash;and who is to judge whether it is right or
      wrong? We achieved dominance of Earth by our moral responsibility to
      family, tribe, and nation&mdash;and we nearly exterminated ourselves when
      we forgot that this responsibility went beyond nations and embraced all
      mankind. We learned that after the Exodus. As for the other races&mdash;perhaps
      someday we will learn moral responsibility for all intelligence&mdash;but
      we are not ready for that yet. That's too big a mental hurdle." Brainard
      sighed. "We are what we are, and we change slowly. But we change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True enough," Kennon said. "But it's hard to be philosophical about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're young. Live a couple of centuries and you will understand
      patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," Brainard said thoughtfully, "you still have plenty of things
      to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. I'll have to make a transcript of this discussion, have it
      witnessed, and make a sealed record. I have to arrange for the reposition
      of the evidence inside the Egg, and a complete recording of the Egg
      itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to be safe you'll need several facsimiles, properly attested. The
      arms of these outworld entrepreneurs are long, and unfortunately not all
      Betans are models of honesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd better get started then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me help you," Brainard said. "I have a little influence in this area&mdash;and
      your cause interests me." He picked up the phone on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sighed. He had found an ally.

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "What are you going to do with that girl?" Brainard asked.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Formalize our mating as soon as she is able to get out of bed," Kennon
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is an ignorant, untrained savage!" Brainard protested. "You should
      hear the stories the nurses tell about her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "You don't have to tell me about those. I've lived with
      Lani for two years. But she's not stupid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your plans?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After we establish her humanity legally," Kennon said, "I'm going to send
      her to school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For twenty years?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If necessary. But I don't think it will take that long. She has some
      schooling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But no training&mdash;and what of the Lani in the meantime?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have plans for that. I'm going back to Kardon and give Alexander a
      chance to make restitution. I think he is an honorable man. Slavery may be
      as revolting to him as it is to any civilized human. He deserves a chance
      to rectify his grandfather's error."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is reasonable&mdash;and in the best traditions of the Brotherhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Furthermore, it's practical," Kennon said. "Alexander is the only one
      fully qualified to handle the problems of enfranchisement. He's known the
      Lani all his life, and he is an executive type. A Brotherhood committee
      would probably botch the whole affair. What with colonial jurisdiction,
      territorial rights, and all the legal quibbling that committees love, the
      Lani would get a poor deal. And there's no reason to wreck the lives of a
      couple of hundred million Kardonians because the rightful owners of Kardon
      were illegally enslaved. That happened too long ago to have any practical
      meaning. There are other and better solutions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should I know?" Kennon asked. "But I'm sure Alexander will. That's
      his field."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All you have to worry about is whether he'll co-operate," Brainard said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll co-operate once he knows the score," Kennon said confidently. "And
      he'll have to make some form of restitution. But it shouldn't involve
      Kardon. Actually the Lani were never in a position to develop that world.
      They'd probably have remained on Flora indefinitely. The old court records
      showed no tendency for their culture to expand. They were an inbred group,
      a static, balanced society in harmony with their environment. In nearly
      thirty-five hundred years their numbers increased only to a few thousand.
      Actually there is a good possibility that the race would ultimately have
      died out if Old Alexander hadn't enslaved them and instituted a controlled
      breeding program. There are more Lani alive today than there were at the
      height of their power. So in a way Old Alexander did them a favor. He kept
      their race alive. All we can expect is a fair and just settlement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if Alexander doesn't co-operate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's where you come in. You'll be a watchdog. If you don't receive
      annual progress reports from me&mdash;and see or talk to me personally
      every second year, you are released from our bond and can do what you wish
      with the evidence I've accumulated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd better get this into Private Record," Brainard said. "We can
      transcribe an agreement and place it in the Public Repository."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good idea and we'd better waste no time. Alexander might still be
      looking for me&mdash;and if he is, it's merely a question of time before
      he catches up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten years have passed. It's doubtful. But we could keep you here at the
      Center."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. "Too dangerous. And besides it would compromise
      you. No&mdash;we'll get everything possible done to make the Lani's case
      airtight, and then I'll return to Kardon. It will put our case in a better
      light if it ever comes to trial, if I go back voluntarily. Anyway&mdash;I'm
      morally bound to return. Now let's make this record."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's your decision," Brainard said. "And it's your neck&mdash;but I must
      admit that I agree with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll feel safer when we get the legal details clarified," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what of the girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you take care of her if I have to leave quickly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I'll give her personal attention, and after she has her child
      I'll see that she is sent to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's decent of you, Doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my moral responsibility," Brainard said as he slipped a new tape
      into the recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper responded quickly to rest and therapy. The space shock cleared up
      quickly. The gerontological treatments put her to bed again, but within a
      month she was completely normal, and her lifespan was now that of a normal
      human. She could look forward to some four hundred years with Kennon&mdash;and
      the prospect was not unpleasant. The Center fascinated her. Never before
      had she seen a hospital devoted to the care and treatment of humans. It
      was a far cry, in its polished steel and stone magnificence, from the tiny
      primitive structure over which Kennon had presided. Yet both places served
      the same purpose. Perhaps Kennon was right&mdash;that there was no
      difference between man and Lani. The idea was not nearly as unbelievable
      as it was at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never realized what it meant to be human," Copper said as she held
      Kennon's hand. "It is nice to feel important and to know that our child is
      a member of the race that rules the galaxy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're convinced?" Kennon chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The serological identity&mdash;" she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hmm. You've been getting some education, I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," Copper smiled, "I didn't think you wanted a stupid woman. I can
      read&mdash;and since you are around so seldom nowadays, there is little
      else to do. I've been reading history, medicine, and novels," she finished
      proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine catholic selection," Kennon said, "Now if you add mathematics,
      sociology, and philosophy you'll have a well-rounded basic education."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Brainard has been trying something he calls 'hypno.' He says it will
      help me learn faster. But I can't see that it's done much good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't until you need the information," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That technique is only good for implanting basic knowledge, and much of
      that will merely supplement or complete that which you already have. You
      won't be conscious of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;I think I see what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you'll have to continue your formal education. There's a great
      deal for you to learn. It should keep you busy while I'm away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away? Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back to Kardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't! Alexander will destroy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think not. After all, ten years have elapsed since we left there and
      he's had plenty of time to think. Douglas must have told him about us. I
      wouldn't be surprised if he has already done something about your people."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered. "He might&mdash;but the question is what would he do? He
      could have killed them all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shook his head. "I don't think so. He never struck me as a mass
      murderer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "You don't know the Alexanders like I do. I was raised
      by them. They're capable of anything. But what is this business of ten
      years? That's silly. I haven't had my child yet&mdash;and it doesn't take
      ten years of pregnancy to produce a baby."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the difference between subjective and objective time," Kennon said.
      "We traveled here through hyperspace&mdash;low Cth&mdash;in an
      uncompensated ship, and there is little temporal flow in the levels below
      the blue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "That would have been Greek to you a couple of weeks ago.
      See where that basic data fits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I've always known that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You just think you have. Search your memory and see if I'm not right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper shook her head. "It's very strange," she said. "But that's not
      important. This idea of going back to Kardon, though&mdash;that's a
      different thing&mdash;that is important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to do it. Not only because it's a personal moral obligation but
      also because of the Lani. They must have their freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Providing there are any still alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop being a calamity howler. Whatever Alexander may be, he's not a
      butcher. He even loved a Lani once. You told me so yourself. And he
      couldn't kill where he loved."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. "I suppose you're right, but I've never lost my fear of the
      Man Alexander. He held the power of life and death over me. But if you
      must go then I should go too. My obligation is greater than yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Later," Kennon said. "You're not ready to return. It will be time enough
      after you have learned some civilized habits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper's face lengthened. "You mean like wrapping myself in cloth like
      these people do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's part of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why can't they be sensible&mdash;or are they so ashamed of what the gods
      gave them that they must hide themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's not that. At least not exactly. It's custom. And you must learn
      to conform to customs&mdash;outwardly at least&mdash;no matter what you
      may really think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that a form of lying?" Copper asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that strange. Your society exalts truth, honor, morality, and
      intelligence&mdash;yet you lie about your attitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's called diplomacy," Kennon said. "It's part of respect for others'
      attitudes and beliefs, a necessary part of human relationships."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you'd be a nudist on Santos?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course&mdash;even though I think it isn't proper, I couldn't inflict
      my ideas and attitudes on the customs of an independent world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh&mdash;you think I'm doing that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;and it is a mark of barbarism."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes you're not very nice," Copper said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon smiled wryly. "I suppose I'm not," he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll try to be civilized," Copper said. "But if you go to Kardon&mdash;I'm
      going with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," Kennon said. "We'll see how things turn out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't want me to go with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be honest&mdash;no," Kennon said. "You're safe here, and until your
      status is cleared by a Brotherhood court, I wouldn't care to place you in
      Alexander's hands. And clearing your status is going to take time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that I am still his property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But there is a legal doubt that will prevent him from exercising his
      claim as long as you stay on Beta. In the area where he has power, that
      doubt might not hold. So until your status is definitely proven to be
      human, you should not leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what happens if this court denies my claim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we appeal to the Council. However, with the evidence we have, your
      claim cannot reasonably be denied. The only question is one of time. It
      may take years. Still, I don't think there is anything to worry about. I
      don't think Alexander will give us any trouble, but there's no sense in
      taking chances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You still think I'm a Lani," she said accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you think that I'd obey Alexander, after what I did to Douglas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only repeat that Douglas isn't the Boss-man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I knew what you really thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't hard. I think you should stay here until I get this business
      straightened out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all?" she asked suspiciously. "After all, I know I'm not very
      pretty now. And there's lots of Lani on Flora&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, for Ochsner's sake! Do you think that I'm&mdash;" He paused,
      speechless. "Just what do you think I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a man. And that's the trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon chuckled. "So that's it! You don't trust me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you," Copper said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I wonder why men ever finalize their status with women," Kennon
      murmured. "It does no good. It doesn't convince the woman. She's still
      fearful, jealous, and suspicious&mdash;always belittling her ability to
      hold what she has, always alert for competition, clinging, holding,
      absorbing&mdash;when she should be working as part of a team."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then prove it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How&mdash;by staying here while you go to the end of the galaxy and play
      noble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm only doing what I have to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so am I&mdash;and if you go I'm going with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shrugged. There was no sense arguing. The only thing to do was make
      his plans and leave quietly. If she was faced with an established fact,
      she might be more reasonable. He doubted it, but alone, she could do
      nothing&mdash;and Brainard would see that she was comfortable. The salvage
      money from the Egg would keep her from being a public charge. And he had
      more banked in Albertsville which he could send her once he got there.
      He'd start making plans to leave as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper looked up at him as he stood above her bed. Slowly she reached out
      and placed one slim hand in his. "I know what you are thinking," she said,
      "and&mdash;" her face twisted in a grimace of pain, and the hand in his
      clutched with convulsive strength at his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing&mdash;it's perfectly normal," she said. "I'm just going to give
      you a son. Now if you'd call for the doctor, perhaps we can get this over.
      That pain was only twenty minutes from the last. I think it's about time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon&mdash;who had attended several hundred Lani births and had
      developed a certain callousness about them&mdash;was suddenly frightened
      and helpless as he pushed the call button. He could feel the cold sweat
      form on his forehead. He had started this. It was his fault if anything
      went wrong. He wished that it was someone else rather than Copper who was
      going through this trial. He was nervous, unsure, and guilty. In a word,
      he felt like a man whose mate was giving birth to their first child.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a boy," Dr. Brainard said. He smiled down at Kennon's haggard face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is Copper?" Kennon asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine&mdash;she's healthy as a horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon winced at the cliche It was so ancient that it had lost all
      meaning. Most Betans didn't know what a horse was, let alone whether it
      was healthy or not. From what Kennon could remember of veterinary history,
      the horse wasn't too healthy an animal. It was rather delicate, in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is the child?" Kennon asked. It took a little courage to ask this
      question. The baby could be anything from normal to a monstrosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly normal," Brainard said. "A true Betan type even down to the
      vestigial tail. We amputated that, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Ochsner!" Kennon breathed. "I was afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you were," Brainard said. "Do you want to see them now? When I
      left, Copper was asking for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon sighed. Leaving, he realized, wasn't going to be as easy as he had
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have to keep them here for a couple of months," Brainard said. "We
      must take exhaustive tests if we expect the court to reverse its prior
      decision."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expected that," Kennon said. He shrugged, "It's probably best," he
      said. "Now show me where Copper is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's back in the same room. You don't need a guide."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon didn't. In fact, he behaved quite admirably.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Longliners, Kennon reflected, didn't make Beta a port of call, and the
      Shortliner connections with other worlds were 'infrequent. Beta had done a
      good job separating from the rest of the Brotherhood. Too good. The
      spaceline schedules showed only one departure in the next month, a
      Shortliner for Earth, and from Earth the road to Kardon was long and
      tortuous, involving a series of short jumps from world to world and a
      final medium-range hop from Halsey to Kardon. If everything went right and
      he made every connection he would be in Kardon four months after he left
      Beta. Kennon sighed as he left Travelers Aid. Morality was a heavy load to
      carry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly down the road from the spaceport toward the Co-operative
      where he had been staying. He had left Huntersville and Copper a week ago,
      after he had seen his child. His child! The thought of being a father was
      oddly dismaying. It distorted his sense of values. But one thing was
      certain. He was returning to Kardon, and Copper was not coming with him.
      She had a duty to their son&mdash;and he had a duty to his contract with
      Alexander, to the Lani on Flora, and to Copper&mdash;and none of these
      could be satisfied by further running. He had to return and settle the
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall man in a conservative yellow-and-black suit was waiting patiently
      in front of his room. "My name is Richter," he said "&mdash;Art Richter.
      Are you Dr. Jac Kennon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could deny it, but I won't," Kennon said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Doctor. It was just a formality anyway. You see, I know you by
      sight." He sighed. "One has to observe the formalities in this business."
      He drew a long white envelope from his tunic and handed it to Kennon.
      "Most of my subjects try to deny their identity," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a refreshing change to find an honest man." He bowed formally. "I
      really thought this would be harder, considering the charges against you."
      He bowed again and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now&mdash;what was that?" Kennon muttered as he opened the envelope. The
      man Richter was undoubtedly a process server&mdash;but who had hired him?
      He unfolded the sheet and scanned the charges&mdash;coercion, larceny,
      livestock theft, and breach of contract. He shrugged. This was Alexander's
      work. What was the man thinking of? It was insanity to bring the Lani
      matter into open court. Hadn't Douglas told him what had happened?
      Couldn't Alexander guess that he had fled with Copper for a good reason&mdash;one
      that would stand up in court? Didn't he know about the spacer? Or had
      Douglas turned on his cousin? The pup had so many hates that it was
      possible. He was a natural troublemaker. Maybe Alexander didn't know.
      Maybe he was working in the dark. Kennon scanned the sheet quickly. Ah!
      here it was. Complaint&mdash;Mr. Alexander X. M. Alexander, Skyline Tower
      1024, Beta City!
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander! Here on Beta! Kennon opened the door of his room, went straight
      to the phone beside the bed. He lifted the handset from its cradle and
      dialed the operator. "Get me Huntersville THU 2-1408. I want to speak to
      Dr. Brainard, Dr. Will Brainard. This is a priority call&mdash;my name is
      Kennon. Dr. Jac Kennon D.V.M. I'm in the registry&mdash;47M 26429&mdash;yes&mdash;of
      course, and thank you." He waited a moment. "Hello&mdash;Dr. Brainard?&mdash;Kennon
      here. I've just had some news. Alexander's on Beta! Yes&mdash;he served me
      with a summons. Can you get a restraining order to prevent him from
      leaving? You can? Good! Here's his address." Kennon rattled off the
      location. "Yes&mdash;I'm taking the next airboat to Beta City. This should
      simplify things considerably.&mdash;Of course it should. He was a fool to
      have come here. Yes&mdash;I suppose you should tell Copper. Oh! She is?
      I'm sorry to hear that, but there's no reason for her to be angry. She
      should realize that I did this for her&mdash;not to make her miserable.
      Hmm.&mdash;She&mdash;she has? You think she should come with me?&mdash;Yes,
      I realize she can be a problem when she wants to be. All right then&mdash;tell
      her to pack a toothbrush and a few spare diapers. And see if you can get
      me a couple of tickets on the next flight to Beta City. I'll be over in a
      couple of hours and pick her up." He cradled the phone and dialed the
      operator again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want the phone number of Skyline Tower 1024, Beta City, Mr. Alexander.
      Yes. I'll wait. This number is HUV 2-1278 and my name is Kennon, Dr. Jac
      Kennon 47M 26429. I called you before. No, I'm a transient. I can refer
      you to Dr. James Brainard, Huntersville Medical Center. Yes, I'll accept
      charges. Now will you give me that number? BCA 7-8941&mdash;thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon hung up, dialed the number, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello," he said. "Mr. Alexander? This is Dr. Kennon.&mdash;Yes&mdash;I
      suppose you do, but I've been trying to get back to Kardon for the past
      month. You are? Well, that's your privilege, but I'd advise you to go easy
      until I see you. Naturally&mdash;I'm coming as soon as I can get there.
      We'll be seeing you tomorrow morning at the latest. We?&mdash;I'm bringing
      Copper, of course. I just wanted you to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon wiped his forehead. Alexander sounded angry and dangerous. Ten
      years hadn't served to cool him off. What had happened on Kardon after he
      had left? Kennon shook his head. There was something here he didn't
      understand. The entrepreneur should have been covering his tracks, not
      threatening jail and disaccreditation. It was obvious that a personal
      visit was more necessary than he had thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander was waiting. His eyebrows rose at the sight of Copper in formal
      Betan dress&mdash;and lifted a trifle more at the sight of the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this, Kennon?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trouble," Kennon said. He took off his hat. "I came here to settle things
      before you took this case to court. You obviously do not understand what
      has happened. I suppose Douglas has double-crossed you. It would be
      characteristic of him. But before we go any further I think we should
      clear the air and let each other know where we stand. I don't want to make
      trouble if it's not necessary. You'll notice I'm not wearing a thought
      screen, so you'll be able to check everything I say, and know I'm telling
      the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It had better be good," Alexander said grimly. "I've been looking for you
      for ten years. I intend to throw the book at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know whether my reason is good or not. Technically I'm guilty of
      breach of contract and larceny of corporation property, but there are
      extenuating circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander chuckled mirthlessly. "There are a few other charges. And quite
      probably I can think of more if you beat these. I'm going to make an
      example of you, Kennon. I'm going to drag you down and stamp on you.
      You're going to be a horrible example to all smart operators who think
      they can break contracts. It's taken a million credits and ten years' time
      to hunt you down, but it's going to be worth it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Copper's child is a boy," Kennon said mildly. "My son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander froze. "You can prove that?" he asked in a half-strangled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon nodded. "You see the extenuating circumstance?" he asked.
      "Suppression of human slavery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander sat down. It was as though some unseen hand had pulled his legs
      from under him. "You believe it," he said. "&mdash;No&mdash;you've proved
      it! Why&mdash;why didn't you tell me? What sort of a man do you think I
      am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know. I couldn't take the chance until Copper was protected. You
      see, sir, I love her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That isn't hard to do with Lani," Alexander said. He sank back in his
      chair, his face clouded, his expression troubled. It was obvious that the
      realization shocked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon felt an odd sympathy for the entrepreneur. It wasn't a nice
      feeling, he suspected, to have the beliefs of a lifetime ripped apart and
      sent to the disposal chute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So the Lani are a human variant," Alexander said dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The proof is here," Kennon said, "and the supporting evidence is
      conclusive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which makes me&mdash;what? A murderer? A slaver? A tyrant?" Alexander
      clutched his head with lean-fingered hands. "What am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An innocent victim of circumstances," Kennon said. "You didn't know. None
      of us knew. And we still wouldn't know if the Lani weren't of Betan
      extraction." He grimaced painfully. "I've done some soul-searching myself,
      and it hasn't been a pleasant task."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's nothing like mine," Alexander said in a low voice. "I suspected
      they were human when I was younger, but I denied my suspicions and
      accepted false facts instead of investigating."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have found nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately, that's not true. We discovered quite a bit from the
      experimental station you left us when you disappeared ten years ago. But
      we stopped when we found the age that was being indoctrinated with Lani
      tabus. We could have gone farther, but I didn't think it was necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't Douglas tell you?" Kennon asked curiously. "I told him when I
      turned him loose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Douglas didn't tell anything except that you had somehow gotten a
      spaceship. I assumed it was one of those that were involved in that
      commercial raid a few decades ago, but I see it wasn't. No&mdash;I knew
      nothing about this development. And Douglas, I guess, wanted to keep it
      hidden. He gave your co-ordinates and ordered Mullins to launch a missile.
      But he apparently forgot to turn on his IFF. At any rate the missile lost
      you&mdash;but found Douglas. Douglas was still talking to Alexandria when
      it struck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might have informed you," Kennon said. "If he had more time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it. He ordered the missile first. He was trying to destroy you
      before you could destroy Outworld Enterprises. His motives were selfish as
      usual." Alexander looked at Kennon with a haggard eye. "I owe you an
      apology," he said. "I've considered you responsible for Douglas's death
      for ten years. I've searched for you on a hundred worlds. My agents in
      every branch office have had standing orders to report any unusual
      arrivals. I have hunted you personally. I wanted to break you&mdash;I
      wanted to kill you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't help the delay," Kennon said. "The ship was old."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. You've told me more than you think. I'm a telepath, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never forgotten it," Kennon said. "That was one of the principal
      reasons I came here. I wanted to see how you'd react when you learned the
      whole truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I suppose you gloat&mdash;no&mdash;you're not doing that. But you are
      right. I could have checked it further. But I didn't. Outworld Enterprises
      is far bigger than Flora&mdash;and I was busy. Galactic trade is a
      snake-pit. And, after all, there was Douglas's death&mdash;and the Family
      with their never-ending clamor for money and their threats when it didn't
      come promptly. I like being an entrepreneur, but until I made Outworld
      independent of Family control, I couldn't do anything except run the
      business to their wishes. Actually the island was only a small part of the
      corporation. I tried to run it as humanely as possible under the
      circumstances." He shuddered. "I don't think I was ever needlessly cruel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Kennon said, "you were indifferent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is just as bad," Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;what are you going to do about it?" Copper interjected. "You
      can beat yourself until you're blue, but that won't accomplish anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?" Alexander countered. "You have the upper
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me?" Copper asked. "I have nothing. This is between you men." She lapsed
      into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander turned back to Kennon. "You have undoubtedly made some
      arrangements. You wouldn't come here&mdash;oh! I see. Congratulations.
      Handling the evidence that way was a wise course. You have my admiration.
      But then I should have known that I was not dealing with a fool." He
      smiled wryly. "Subconsciously I think I did know&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's one consolation," Kennon grinned. "To be thought a rascal is bad
      enough, but to be considered a fool is intolerable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your decision not to use the evidence unless you were forced to&mdash;that's
      poor business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But good morals," Kennon said. "Neither the Brotherhood nor I could
      settle this affair. It is a matter only you can handle. There is no sense
      in killing Outworld or throwing Kardon into centuries of litigation. The
      Lani never were numerous enough to lay claim to an entire world. I'll
      admit the club is there, but I'll never use it unless it's necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?&mdash;it's sound business practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a professional&mdash;not a businessman. And besides, I haven't the
      moral right to return evil for good. You have not been a bad boss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks," Alexander said glumly. "I've always considered myself
      civilized."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't go so far as to say that," Kennon said. "Honorable, yes&mdash;civilized,
      no. But none of us are really civilized."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We haven't changed much, despite our development. Perhaps we've varied a
      little physically&mdash;and we've learned to use new tools, but our minds
      are still the minds of barbarians&mdash;blood brothers against the enemy,
      and everything not of us is enemy. Savages&mdash;hiding under a thin
      veneer of superficial culture. Savages with spaceships and the atom."
      Kennon looked down at Copper. Apparently her thoughts were miles away in
      an introspective world that was all her own. She had said her piece and
      having done that was content to let the two men develop it. Kennon looked
      at her with odd respect. Alexander eyed her with a mildly startled
      expression on his lean face. And both men smiled, but the smiles were not
      amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judging from Copper," Alexander said, "I don't think we'll have to worry
      about how the Lani will turn out." He looked at Kennon with mild sympathy.
      "You are going to have quite a time with her," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so. I'll probably never know whether I'm guided or whether I'm
      doing the guiding. I've changed a lot of my opinions about Copper since
      the day I met her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Copper looked up and smiled at them. It was an odd smile, hinting at
      secrets neither of them would ever know. Alexander chuckled. "It serves
      you right." He crossed his legs and looked up at Kennon standing before
      him. By some uncanny legerdemain he had gotten control of himself and the
      situation at the same time. Being telepathic was an unfair advantage,
      Kennon thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were equally unfair with your accusation," Alexander said. "Sure&mdash;humanity
      makes mistakes, and like this one they're sometimes brutal mistakes. But
      we are capable of atonement. Morally we have come a long way from the
      brutality of the Interregnum. I shouldn't have to use examples, but look
      at that"&mdash;he waved at the view wall at the panorama of gleaming fairy
      towers and greenery that made Beta City one of the most beautiful in the
      Brotherhood. "Don't tell me that five thousand years of peace and
      development haven't produced civilization. That's a concrete example out
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't," Kennon said flatly. "Sure, it's pretty&mdash;clean&mdash;and
      beautifully designed for art and utility&mdash;but it isn't civilization.
      You're confusing technology with culture. You look at this and say, 'What
      a great civilization man has built,' when you really mean, 'What a great
      technology mankind has developed.' There's all the difference in the
      world. Technology is of the mind and hands. Civilization is of the spirit&mdash;and
      spiritually we are still in the Dark Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We conquer, kill, loot, and enslave. We establish standards to keep
      humanity a closed corporation, a special club in which men can live but
      aliens can't. We've made the standards for admission so rigid that we even
      enslave our own kind and call them animals. That's not civilization&mdash;that's
      savagery!
    </p>
    <p>
      "For nearly five hundred years your family has run a slave pen. Your
      fortune is based upon it. And you have perpetuated this traffic in flesh
      on the specious reasoning that a court judgment of half a millennium ago
      is as good today as when it was handed down. Never once did anyone have
      the moral courage to re-examine that old decision. Never once did any
      human question the rightness of that decision. None of us are immune. We
      all based our conduct upon an antiquated law and searched no further.
      Everyone was happy with the status quo&mdash;or at least not so unhappy
      that they wanted to change it. Even I would have been content had it not
      been for Copper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I do not feel that it was bad that I hired you," Alexander said.
      "Even though you have shown me that I am a slaver, and made me see faults
      I never knew I had." His face was drawn&mdash;harsh lines reached from
      nose to lips, from eyes to chin. Suddenly he looked old. "I can accept
      censure if censure is just. And this is just. No&mdash;I'm not sorry I
      hired you even though the thought of what I have helped do to the Lani
      makes me sick to my stomach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;" Kennon said. "What are you going to do about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," Alexander said. "At the first smell of trouble, the Family
      will turn tail and run. You can break the company, and I won't stand in
      your way. It's only just. You're the one who's carrying the ball. Now run
      with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That damned blind spot," Kennon said. "You realize, of course, that
      you're not legally liable. It was a mistake. All you have to do is admit
      the error and start from there. Naturally&mdash;no reasonable intelligence
      would expect that you change the older Lani. They're too old for either
      agerone or change. It would be both cruel and inhuman to turn them loose.
      It's with the youngsters that you can work&mdash;those who are physically
      and physiologically young enough to derive benefit from agerone and
      education.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I remember, you bought a planet called Phoebe. Now why don't you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Phase out! Of course! But that means that you can't press charges."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I? I'm not one of these starry-eyed reformers who expect to
      change things overnight. It's the future of the Lani race that's
      important, And Brainard agrees with me. A phase-out is the proper
      solution. Change the education, let males be born&mdash;teach the young to
      think instead of to obey. Give them Phoebe for a home&mdash;they never
      owned all of Kardon anyway. And within a century or two we will have a new
      group of the human race&mdash;and then we can tell the Brotherhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon looked inquiringly at Copper. She smiled and nodded. "It would
      cause less trouble that way," she said. "It would be more sure&mdash;and
      there are never too many old ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon shuddered, thinking of the euthanasia chambers on Otpen One. "There
      will be more from now on," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Outworld can afford it. It'll bend us a little but we won't break&mdash;and
      besides, the Lani will need our help for some time to come." Alexander
      looked at Kennon. "Can we make an agreement that all parties will
      respect?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so&mdash;providing there are no sleeper clauses in it," Kennon
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There won't be," Alexander said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there weren't.
    </p>
    <p>
      * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a private ceremony. The Family, sulky and unwilling, faced with a
      choice of drastically reduced income or outright confiscation and
      preferring a portion of a loaf to none. Alexander&mdash;grim but oddly
      peaceful of expression. Brainard&mdash;pink-cheeked and emotionless.
      Kennon and Copper&mdash;happily conscious that it was at last finished. It
      was an oddly assorted group of conspirators who planned to restore a
      segment of humanity to the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kennon signed last, and as he did, Alexander looked at him with a sly grin
      distorting the smooth pallor of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forgot something," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" Kennon said&mdash;aware suddenly that something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you plan to do, now that this is over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Join the Medical Center here and practice veterinary medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wouldn't care to work for me&mdash;to help rebuild the wreckage
      you've helped create? I'll need a manager on Kardon to phase out the
      island while we phase in Phoebe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you. I've had enough of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You just think you have," Alexander said gleefully. "That's what you have
      forgotten. You've gotten your agreement&mdash;now you will satisfy me. As
      I see it you have breached your contract by leaving Flora without
      authorization."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right," Kennon said. A small lump of lead began to grow rapidly
      larger in his stomach. Brainard was grinning and Copper's eyes were
      shining. "You've been jobbed!" his mind told him. He sighed. He knew what
      was coming next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The punitive clause for breach of contract," Alexander went on
      inexorably, "is very broad. Discretion is vested in the entrepreneur. I
      can obtain judgment against you in any court on any planet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," Kennon said glumly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am going to be civilized," Alexander said. "I am going to be
      merciful. I am going to extend your contract until phase-out has been
      completed. You are going to have control of the entire Kardon phase of the
      operation. It's poetic justice&mdash;you made the mess&mdash;now you can
      clean it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's inhuman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humanity has nothing to do with it. It's justice," Alexander said. He
      smiled at Copper's radiant face. The thought of going home was good to
      her. "Good luck on your new job, Dr. Kennon," he said. "And welcome to the
      brotherhood of the ulcer."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
